Catching the attention of devotees and tourists visiting the newly constructed Ram temple is ""International Shree Sitaram Bank"". The deposits here are booklets with ""Sitaram"" scribbled on all pages. The spiritual bank, which was set up in November 1970 by Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, the chief of the Shri Ramjanmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, has over 35,000 account-holders in India and abroad including the US, the UK, Canada, Nepal, Fiji, the UAE and other countries.  The bank has a collection of 20,000 crore 'Sitaram' booklets from the devotees of Lord Ram. According to Punit Ram Das Maharaj, the manager of the bank, the number of daily visitors at the bank has increased after the consecration ceremony of the grand temple last month. ""The bank provides free booklets and red pens to devotees and keeps track of each account. One has to write 'Sitaram' at least 5 lakh times to get an account opened in the bank and then a passbook is issued. ""There are 136 branches of the bank across India and even abroad. The account holders also send us the booklets by post and we maintain the ledger here,"" Puneet Ram Das told PTI. He said the visitors also question the benefits of writing Sitaram and depositing it into bank. ""I tell them that the way we visit temples of gods and goddesses for inner peace, faith and virtue, in the same way, writing 'Sitaram' and depositing the same into the bank is a form of a prayer. Don't we say that God has his own account of everyone's good and bad deeds? This is something similar. ""The devotees find solace and profound spiritual enrichment in writing, chanting and reminiscing Lord Ram's name,"" he added. Puneet Ram Das explained that it is believed that by writing the name 84 lakh times, one can attain 'Moksha'. Jeetu Nagar, from Gaya in Bihar, who has been visiting the bank for 14 years, said this is his only form of prayers. ""Instead of praying at a temple, I practise this and it has always worked for me whenever I have felt low or have been in trouble. I write it throughout the year and deposit at the bank once a year. There is an option to send by post too, but I prefer to visit myself,"" he said. Nagar said he has already deposited booklets with a name count of 1.37 crore. Suman Das, another account holder from Bareily in Uttar Pradesh said, said he has written 'Sitaram' 25 lakh times.

Delhi Police, sources said, is on high alert ahead of the farmers' march to the national capital. About 200 farmer organisations are part of the protest plan. They have several demands, including a law to guarantee Minimum Support Price and pension benefits. The capital's cops, sources said, are blocking the city's borders with Haryana by placing massive containers. Cranes have been deployed to move these barriers if farmers try to cross into Delhi. In fact, Haryana too has brought in cement barriers to ensure that the protesting farmers cannot enter Delhi.  The cops of Haryana and Punjab are reportedly using tractors to simulate the protest and practise how they will respond. A total of 40 such rehearsal using tractors -- 10 in Haryana, 30 in Punjab -- have been held so far. In Delhi, cops are holding drills to practise firing teargas shells if farmers refuse to stop. A video accessed by NDTV shows cops lining up and firing teargas shells in an open area in north Delhi. The exercise, meanwhile, has left local residents in discomfort. Many of them complained of burning sensation in their eyes after the drill. ""I feel a burning sensation in my eye and nose. It seems my eyes and nose have got blocked,"" a local resident told news agency ANI. Intelligence inputs say as many as 20,000 farmers with 2,000 tractors may try to enter Delhi day after tomorrow. These farmers are from Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. The cops fear ant-social elements can enter the agitation and disrupt law and order. The cops have also factored in that farmers may use cars, two-wheelers, Metro or buses to hoodwink police. Some farmers, they said, may also come beforehand and gather outside the homes of VIPs such as the Prime Minister, ministers and BJP leaders. Women and children, sources said, may also be involved in the protests.

Union minister Nitin Gadkari announced that GPS-based toll collection systems will replace existing highway toll plazas in the country. Road, Transport and Highways minister announced that transition will occur as early as April this year. The government has appointed a consultant to implement a GPS-based toll collection system on national highways, the minister said on Thursday.  The Road Transport and Highways Minister also said the system will be introduced on a pilot basis in addition to FASTags. The move is aimed at reducing traffic congestion and charging motorists for the exact distance travelled on the highways.  Mr Gadkari had earlier said state-owned NHAI's toll revenue is currently Rs 40,000 crore and it is going to soar to Rs 1.40 lakh crore in 2-3 years.  ""The government is looking at new technologies including GPS-based toll systems to replace toll plazas in the country...We will bring new technology in six months,"" he said. During 2018-19, the average waiting time for vehicles at toll plaza was 8 minutes. With the introduction of FASTags during 2020-21 and 2021-22, the average waiting time of the vehicles was reduced to 47 seconds. Since 2021, FASTags became mandatory for all vehicles to pay tolls on highways. Vehicles without FASTags are required to pay double the toll fee as a fine.  Although there is considerable improvement in waiting time at certain locations, especially near cities, in densely-populated towns, there are still some delays at toll plazas during peak hours. The GPS-based electronic toll collection system will use an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system through cameras installed on highways and deduct tolls based on the distance travelled by a vehicle. At present, FASTags uses RFID-based toll collection at plazas.  PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The device monitors your movements while driving, accurately marking your entry and exit points on tolled segments. By analyzing your travel distance, it identifies the toll plazas you've passed through and computes the charges accordingly. This eliminates the uniformity of fixed tolls at booths, ensuring fairness for drivers traversing shorter distances. Furthermore, drivers on the road are relieved from concerns about handling cash, waiting for change, or checking their FASTag account balance. The toll fee is automatically deducted from your linked account using a secure electronic payment system. This process also eradicates human errors and the possibility of toll evasion.

(File) The Russian envoy to India, Denis Alipov, said on Saturday while his country remains New Delhi's ""reliable and time-tested friend"", the US is trying to threaten the relationship with sanctions. ""In India, Russia enjoys a solid reputation as a reliable, sincere, well-intentioned, time-tested friend. Such an image was initially shaped due to the major contribution of the USSR to Indian socio-economic development, and it largely persists to this day,"" he said. In an interview with the RT news agency, the Russian envoy added, ""US officials who come here do not hesitate to directly state that they are pursuing the goal of tearing New Delhi away from Moscow. They are even making threats with secondary sanctions. Some Indian partners are forced to exercise caution, sometimes, frankly speaking, excessively, but there are also a significant number of those for whom such an approach is unacceptable.""  Highlighting the growing bilateral ties, the Russian envoy said, ""Our ties continue to steadily expand in a wide range of areas according to our converging national interests. But unlike our Western partners, we have never conditioned cooperation on politics, have not interfered in domestic affairs, and have always maintained mutually respectful and trusted relationships. Therefore, even now we mainly see a growing desire to keep working together and finding ways to overcome well-known impediments caused by destructive unilateral approaches."" ""It should be noted that over the recent years the number of such contacts has increased manifold, and they are becoming more and more meaningful, including distributing information detailing the economic and investment potential and promising areas for interaction. It is indicative that the current bilateral trade turnover, which at the end of 2023 may exceed $60 billion, is several times higher than the pre-sanctions figures,"" he added. Alipov also called for urgent reforms of the United Nations and agencies under it while making a strong case for the inclusion of India as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. ""We are of the view that India as a permanent member of the Security Council could make a significant contribution to promoting balance as well as an agenda focused on the interests of the world majority, primarily the countries of the Global South,"" the Russian envoy said. India and Russia have maintained a robust strategic partnership, rooted in historical ties and shared interests, over decades. Central to this relationship is extensive defence cooperation, with Russia serving as a major supplier of military equipment to India and both nations engaging in joint military exercises, co-development of advanced military platforms, and technology transfers, according to the Russian news agency. More recently, energy collaboration has become another strong pillar of bilateral ties. The Kudankulam nuclear power plant (KNPP), India's largest, is being built in Tamil Nadu with technical assistance provided by Moscow. Russia's expertise in nuclear technology has been instrumental in advancing India's capabilities, fostering a mutually beneficial partnership, according to RT.

The row over BJP leader KS Eshwarappa's 'shoot the traitor' remark intensified on Saturday with the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka filing an FIR against him and the leader asserting that he is not scared of such cases. The controversy broke out on Thursday after former minister Eshwarappa said at an event in Davangere: ""I want to appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring a law to shoot the two traitors - D K Suresh and Vinay Kulkarni, who want South India to be a separate country."" Subsequently, a case was registered by the Davangere Extension Police Station based on a complaint by Hanumanthappa (36), a resident of the area. Reacting to the case, Mr Eshwarappa told reporters in Shivamogga that he was not scared of such FIRs.  ""I am not scared of 100 such FIRs against me on the principles related to nationalism and Hindutva,"" he added. The FIR was registered after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said on Friday that legal action would be taken against the BJP leader for his statement. Mr Siddaramaiah also wondered whether this was the language of a leader belonging to a national party. Claiming that the taxes collected from the southern states were being distributed to north India, Suresh, Congress MP and brother of Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister, DK Shivakumar, said on February 1 that the southern states would be forced to demand a separate nation if the 'injustice' was not rectified. Following Mr Eshwarappa's remark, Mr Suresh on Saturday dared him to shoot him down instead of waiting for others to do the job. ""Why should anyone else shoot me? If you (Mr Eshwarappa) give me time, I will stand before you for the sake of Karnataka, its land and Kannadigas,"" Mr Suresh told reporters here. He said he would soon fix a time to meet the BJP leader. ""You want your leadership to appreciate you. Why (are you) going here and there in search (of killers)? I will come to your house. I will soon fix a time and meet you within a week. Be prepared whether you want to shoot me or stab me,"" the Bengaluru Rural MP said. Mr Shivakumar said his brother knew how to handle such threats. ""Suresh isn't the type of person to get scared by threats. We know how to deal with it. We have settled many such threats in the past,"" the deputy chief minister told reporters here. Mr Shivakumar said every action has a consequence. ""Eshwarappa once spoke about my father in the Assembly and everyone knows what happened next. Where is Eshwarappa today?"" he said. Reacting to the development, former Chief Minister and BJP stalwart BS Yediyurappa said some people were giving a twist to Mr Eshwarappa's 'shoot the traitors' remark to give a different connotation. ""People are talking about Mr Eshwarappa's statement in a way to convey a negative meaning. Mr Eshwarappa had only asked for a law to shoot down traitors. There is no connection between Mr Eshwarappa's statement and the comments made against him,"" Mr Yediyurappa told reporters in Shivamogga. Mr Yediyurappa said Eshwarappa is capable of facing the FIR against him. Reacting to Mr Eshwarappa's comment, former BJP chief minister Jagadish Shettar insisted upon remaining well within the limits. ""Mr Eshwarappa has defended his statement. I have said several times in the past that nobody should cross the 'Lakshman Rekha',"" Mr Shettar said in Hubballi. Former BJP MLA MP Renukacharya backed Mr Eshwarappa saying that no one can keep mum on the partition of the country. ""Mr Eshwarappa is a staunch Hindutva supporter. He has only spoken the truth. How can he stay silent when someone talks about partition of the country?"" Mr Renukacharya said. He alleged that Congress' state unit's demonstration in Delhi against the alleged injustice to Karnataka on February 7 was aimed at diverting public attention from the controversy arising due to Suresh's statement. Reacting to Eshwarappa's remark, Karnataka IT/BT Minister Priyank Kharge said it reflected the level of intellect of the BJP leader. ""Your (Eshwarappa's) statement to bring in a law to shoot down shows your level of intellect. Why his statements should be taken seriously when he is not in the game?

The incident happened on January 17, the day two Manipur Police commandos were killed in action while returning fire at insurgents. A day after the gunfight, Manipur Security Adviser Kuldiep Singh had told reporters that ""numerous Kuki militants started firing at commando posts in three locations"", and the commandos being at a lower elevation were ""sitting ducks"". In the videos that surfaced on social media today, which sources said have been verified as taken on January 17, Assam Rifles soldiers inside an armoured vehicle were heard shouting warnings at the armed men who were blocking their way.  ""Please go to the side. Don't do this. Don't fire at our vehicle,"" a soldier is heard saying. Then the armed men in camouflaged battledress, numbering some 10-15, surrounded the armoured vehicle and waved at the soldiers to not press on. At this, the soldier inside the vehicle shouts, ""All of you stop firing. Aap logon ko nuksaan hoga (it won't be good for you). Get to the side. Let our vehicle go. Why don't you understand?"" The Assam Rifles uses an evolved Indian version of the South African-origin Casspir mine-protected vehicle. The armed men brought out two crude rocket launchers - one was pointed at the vehicle directly from the front, while the other was aimed at the vehicle from higher ground on the right. Another man armed with what appeared to be a foreign-origin M series (M4, M16, etc) assault rifle brought a handheld improvised explosive device (IED), stood near the front right tyre, and gestured as if he would throw the IED under the vehicle. ""IED leke aa gaya,"" another soldier inside the mine-protected vehicle is heard saying. Unable to proceed, the vehicle reversed slowly on the inclined gravel path which did not have enough space for a full turn. The armed men continued to follow, guns pointed at the vehicle. Another armed man was seen moving the crude rocket launcher to keep it aimed at the vehicle. The Assam Rifles have in the past rescued police commandos pinned down with suppressive fire by hill-based insurgents in and around Moreh. The January 17 attack at the police commandos involved rocket-propelled grenades fired by insurgents. Kuldiep Singh, the state Security Adviser, had said there was a possibility that Myanmar-based insurgents may have entered Manipur, but there was no evidence yet. At least 25 Kuki insurgent groups have signed the tripartite suspension of operations (SoO) agreement with the Centre and the state. Under the SoO agreement, the insurgents are housed in designated camps. There have been allegations that full attendance at many of the SoO camps has not been observed. A retired top-ranking army officer from Manipur, Lieutenant General LN Singh (retired), blamed the ineffectiveness of the SoO agreement for the rising threat by ""Kuki militants"". ""Kuki militants, encouraged by immunity from SoO agreement and leniency (sic) shown on them, are now directly threatening other security forces. More than 15 years of SoO, how much more? There has to be a timeline. Someone has to answer as to how much more taxpayers' money will be spent,"" Lt General Singh said in a post on the social media platform X.

A heart-warming tale of a mother's long-lost son returning as a monk after 22 years has, in less than a fortnight, devolved into a heart-rending story of a family being scammed.  The joy of Delhi resident Bhanumati Singh knew no bounds when she was reunited last month with her son Pinku, who had left home at the age of 11. She had scolded Pinku over playing too much and, in a fit of rage, he had run away from their Delhi home in 2002.  Last month, Bhanumati and her husband, Ratipal Singh, got information that an ascetic was visiting Ratipal's native village, Kharauli in Amethi, and he bore the same scar as Pinku. His relatives - including his sister, who stays in the village - asked Ratipal and Bhanumati to rush to Kharauli and, when they reached there on January 27, the ascetic told them that he was indeed their son.  A video of the ascetic seeking alms from Bhanumati, singing folk songs about a king who left his kingdom to become a monk, went viral. In the video, tears of joy can be seen streaming down Bhanumati's cheek. A twist followed, with a bigger one yet to come. Pinku told them that he had taken sanyaas (renounced earthly pleasures) and had to return to his monastery, Parasnath Math, in Jharkhand. He said his guru had told him his initiation would be complete only after he visited Ayodhya and then took alms from his family members. The parents initially refused to let Pinku go but, realising that his heart was set on following the path he was on, eventually gave in. Villagers came together to contribute 13 quintals of foodgrain as alms and Ratipal's sister also gave him Rs 11,000. Ratipal bought Pinku a phone and asked him to keep in touch. Pinku left the village on February 1. Police Complaint After Pinku left, he began calling Ratipal and said he wanted to return to them, but claimed that people at the monastery had told him he couldn't do so until he had given them Rs 10 lakh. This, he told Ratipal, was the price a monk had to pay to return to family life. Desperate to have his son back with the family, Ratipal sold his land in the village for Rs 11.2 lakh and then told Pinku that he would come to Jharkhand to give the money to the monastery. According to a police official, Pinku gave several reasons - none very believable - for why Ratipal should not come to the monastery. He also began insisting that Ratipal send him the money via bank transfer or using a UPI app. This made Ratipal suspicious and he began making enquiries, only to find that there was no Hindu monastery in Jharkhand by the name of Parasnath Math.  ""On Saturday, Ratipal filed a complaint in Jais police station (in Amethi district),"" said Tiloi Circle Officer Ajay Kumar Singh. Police then found that the man masquerading as Pinku was actually someone called Nafees from Gonda village, who was trying to scam the family. Family Business? An official said further enquiries revealed that Nafees' brother, Rashid, had posed as an ascetic and cheated a family of lakhs using nearly the same playbook in July 2021. Ravi, the son of a man named Budhiram Vishwakarma had gone missing from Sahaspura village 14 years ago and Rashid had reached the village pretending to be an ascetic. He claimed he was Ravi and asked Budhiram's wife for alms.  The family made Rashid stay with them thinking he was Ravi and then he disappeared with lakhs in cash. His true identity came to the fore when he was arrested later.  A few days before Rashid reached Sahaspura village, a relative of Nafees showed up at the house of Kallu Rajbhar in Varanasi's Hajipur village. In an ascetic's attire, he pretended to be Kallu's son, who had gone missing 15 years ago.

The 17th Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die on Saturday bringing the curtains down on the House that witnessed several landmark decisions, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserting that game-changing reforms during its five-year tenure laid the foundation of a strong India. As the adjournment of Parliament for an indefinite period with the Rajya Sabha also adjourning sine die kickstarts the final countdown for the general elections, PM Modi said the last five years were a period of ""reform, perform and transform"" with the country moving towards ""big changes"" at a fast pace. The Lok Sabha elections are expected to take place in April and May. As MPs bade goodbye to the 17th Lok Sabha which will be remembered for some defining moments, unprecedented security breach and record suspension of 100 MPs for unruly conduct, PM Modi praised the outgoing House, saying many decisions including the repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution and the passage of Women's reservation bill were taken during its tenure for which many generations had long waited.  Scrapping of Article 370, which had given special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and building of Ram temple in Ayodhya were part of BJP's core agenda for decades. The Ram temple construction took centre stage on the last day of Parliament's budget session with both houses holding a discussion on its consecration ceremony on January 22 and PM Modi saying adoption of a laudatory resolution on the historic event will give constitutional strength to the future generations to feel proud of the country's values. PM Modi also said the 17th Lok Sabha saw 97 per cent productivity. ""We are moving towards the end of the 17th Lok Sabha and we resolve that the productivity should ensure 100 per cent in the 18th Lok Sabha,"" PM Modi said. With 353 MPs, the BJP-led NDA had a brute majority in the lower house. ""Several challenges were met and the country was given an appropriate direction. We can say with satisfaction that the work for which many generations waited for centuries was accomplished in the 17th Lok Sabha,"" he said. ""These five years have been of reform, perform and transform. It is rare that we reform, perform and also see transformation. The country will keep blessing the 17th Lok Sabha,"" he said in his last address to the outgoing House. The current House had the shortest number of sittings--272--among the Lok Sabhas that had a full term of five years since 1952, data compiled by think tank PRS Legislative Research showed. In his valedictory address, Speaker Om Birla said the 17th Lok Sabha had a total of 274 sittings which lasted for 1,354 hours, 345 hours more than the scheduled time. ""A total of 387 hours were lost due to disruptions in this Lok Sabha. The total work productivity of the 17th Lok Sabha has been around 97 per cent which is the highest among the last five Lok Sabhas,"" he said. ""The 17th Lok Sabha passed 222 bills. During this period 202 bills were introduced and 11 bills were withdrawn by the government."" The Lok Sabha also saw passage of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill and enactment of farm sector reforms that drew widespread year-long protests in the National Capital Region(NCR). The protests forced the government to roll back the three contentious farm laws. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury told the Lok Sabha that browbeating those who hold an alternate view should be avoided as he noted that though disruptions result in loss of legislative business, they were part of democratic system. He said one of the key moments of the outgoing house was the switch from the old to the new building and ""old timers"" like him were trying to adjust. Speaker Birla moved a resolution on the Ram temple, describing its construction as a historic achievement, and said it will give the values of hope and unity to future generations. He later said the resolution was passed by the House. Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the new Parliament building on May 28. He also installed the sacred ‘Sengol' in the Lok Sabha chamber. The building reflects aspirations of new India, every Indian is full of pride today, he had said. In a major security breach on December 13 last year coinciding with the anniversary of the Parliament attack, two persons jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour, released yellow smoke from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by the MPs. One of the accused had hidden a canister in his shoes. In his last address in the outgoing House, PM Modi also took a swipe at the opposition which has constantly targeted the BJP over the temple issue, ""This is true that not everyone has the capacity for these things. Some people are brave to face it while others run away from the battlefield. But for the future record, the speeches that were made today have sensitivity, resolve and sympathy... It also takes forward the mantra of 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'."" He added, ""The country has moved towards big changes at a fast pace and all members of the House made an important contribution."" For generations, people dreamt of one Constitution but this House made that possible by removing Article 370, PM Modi said and noted that several other important decisions like the bill for grant of 33 per cent reservation to women in Parliament and legislative assemblies and criminalisation of instant triple talaq were taken as well. India got the presidency of G-20 during this period and every state presented the country's strength and its identity in front of the world, he said. ""We can proudly say that this country might have lived under 'penal code' for 75 years but now we live under 'Nyay Samhita',"" the prime minister said in reference to the new criminal laws which replaced British era Acts. Referring to the Covid pandemic, Modi said that during the last five years, the ""biggest crisis of the century"" was seen, and Speaker Birla made arrangements so that parliamentary work is not hampered while ensuring the dignity of the House. He said thousands of cumbersome compliances were removed in the last five years to make the lives of common citizens easier. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned sine die after a short-duration discussion on the 'White Paper on the Indian Economy' and the construction of Ram temple. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Replying to the discussion on the White Paper, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman accused the UPA government of mismanaging the price situation after taking charge from the Vajpayee government in 2004, and mocked the Congress, saying 'Gur ko gobar karna inki maastaree hai' (Congress has a mastery of ruining something that has been accomplished).

Opposition Congress said the attack on the ""outspoken journalist"" reflected the collapse of law and order in the state. A day after a car carrying Mr Wagle and others to a public meeting came under attack, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered at Parvati police station in the city on Saturday evening, said a police official.  The accused were booked under Indian Penal Code sections 147 (rioting), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon or means), 336 (causing grievous hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety), 427 (causing damage to property) and other relevant provisions, he said. Protesting against the senior journalist's comments about the Narendra Modi government conferring the country's highest civilian honour `Bharat Ratna' on BJP veteran LK Advani, alleged BJP activists vandalised a car in which Mr Wagle and activists Aseem Sarode and Vishwambhar Choudhary were travelling under police protection to the 'Nirbhay Bano' public meeting organised by Rashtra Seva Dal on Friday evening. The complaint filed by a woman, on which the FIR was based, claimed that she and a few others were protecting Mr Wagle's car even as some BJP workers hurled stones at the vehicle and injured them. Arrested workers were identified as Deepak Pote, Ganesh Ghosh, Ganesh Sherla, Raghvendra Mankar, Swapnil Naik, Pratik Desarda, Dushyant Mohol, Datta Sagre, Girish Mankar and Rahul Paygude. Police also registered a case against Mr Wagle and Pune city unit presidents of the BJP, Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress for allegedly violating section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. ""The case was registered against them as the event (`Nirbhay Bano' public meeting) was being held without police permission,"" said Sambhaji Kadam, deputy commissioner of police. Earlier, another case had been registered against Mr Wagle for allegedly making offensive remarks against PM Modi and Advani under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 500 (defamation) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) at Vishrambaug police station on a complaint lodged by BJP leader Sunil Deodhar. In a statement issued from the national capital, the The Editors Guild of India condemned the attack on the journalist. ""The Editors Guild calls on the administration in Pune and the Maharashtra government to book the guilty,"" it said. It also noted that FIRs were registered against Mr Wagle over his statement, and expressed deep concern about the ""misuse of criminal laws against journalists in an effort to intimidate and harass them."" ""We urge law enforcement agencies to exercise restraint before registering complaints against journalists as an FIR, lest the process of investigation becomes a punishment itself,"" the Guild said. In a post on X in Hindi, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""Law and order has collapsed under the Maharashtra government formed by the BJP's stealing of mandate."" ""A politician is being brutally murdered on Facebook Live. An outspoken journalist is being attacked by unruly goons of the BJP-RSS. A BJP MLA is openly shooting at another politician in the police station,"" Kharge said. He was referring to the murder of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Abhishek Ghosalkar in Mumbai and an incident in Thane district earlier this month where BJP MLA Ganpat Gaikwad opened fire inside a police station and injured a worker of the Shiv Sena. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Mr Kharge further said that economic development of Maharashtra became possible because Congress governments maintained law and order, but the BJP government ""formed with the force of the Enforcement Directorate"" was playing with the security of the people of Maharashtra by spreading ""goonda raj"".

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/if-india-has-to-turn-into-technology-based-country-in-coming-years-isro-chief-5033036,"""If India Has To Turn Into Technology-Based Country In Coming Years..."": ISRO Chief","""We do not want the occasional Chandrayaan or Aditya mission,"" he said (File) The Indian space sector is changing from a ""closed"" and ""secretive"" society to an open one and the objective behind it is to turn it into an economic or business activity instead of government programme, ISRO Chairman S Somanath said here on Saturday. The change in mindset has been influenced by how space-related activities in countries like the USA have been turned into an economic activity, Somnath said while speaking at the Mathrubhumi International Festival of Letters (MBIFL) 2024 being held at Kanakakunnu Palace here. The ISRO Chairman said that in the past 60 years, the work of the space sector -- from making rockets to satellites -- was aimed at societal application, for delivering services that benefit the common man.  As a result, the budget of the space programme was ""very less"" -- Rs 10,000 crore, he said during a session of the fifth edition of the MBIFL. So, with an aim to increase that by 10 times, it was decided to bring some changes to the space policy of the country, he added. The changes would include delegating to the private sector the manufacture of rockets and satellites, research activity being done by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and increasing scientific missions like Chandrayaan, Aditya L1 and Gaganyaan, he said. ""We do not want the occasional Chandrayaan or Aditya mission. We need to have a sustained science programme. For that we primarily need to increase exploration of Mars and the Moon. ""We want our own space station, to do zero gravity space research with the participation of industries and speed up work to send manned missions to space so that we reach a point where we are ready to set foot on the Moon. This is the vision now and that is what we are working on,"" Mr Somnath said. Therefore, all ISRO centres in the country, for the last 2-3 months, have been working on designs for a space station, devising plans to send more missions to the Moon and get more samples from there, build a station there, etc., he said. ""India is not the only country focused on these things. This is being done by the USA, Europe, Japan and China. ""So, in the coming years, if India has to turn into a technology-based country, we need to realise that space is an important aspect and accordingly, create an ecosystem for manufacture of rockets and satellites here in India by multinational companies,"" the ISRO Chairman said. As part of that, discussions are going on with various companies like Boeing for making rockets and satellites in India and launching them from here, he said. ""These were things that were never thought of in the past. Space was a closed society. There was a lot of secrecy. We have now removed the feathers of secrecy and are bringing an openness to it. ""This is being done because it (space sector) has to be turned into a business activity, then a lot of new actors, startups and industries need to come into it. So, it is a huge policy change that we are making in this sector,"" he said. The MBIFL which began on February 8 will conclude on February 11.

The buzz around the Jayant Chaudhary-led RLD joining hands with the NDA and the consternation this has caused in the troubled INDIA alliance spilled over into Parliament on Saturday, sparking a sharp exchange between Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar. When Mr Dhankhar appeared to accuse the Congress of ""insulting"" a Bharat Ratna recipient, Mr Kharge lost his cool and asked the Vice President to not indulge in politics. The Vice-President then retorted, ""Because I come from the farmer community, does not mean I am a weak Chairman. I have tolerated a lot."" The exchange began after Jayant Chaudhary, whose party is a member of the INDIA alliance, rose in the Rajya Sabha and started thanking the BJP-led NDA government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing that the Bharat Ratna would be conferred posthumously on his grandfather Chaudhary Charan Singh. Congress leaders objected to the speech and Mr Dhankhar then asked Mr Kharge to either ""control your people or rise and address the House"".  Prefacing his remarks with the assertion that he and the Congress were happy that former Prime Ministers Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh, and the father of the Green Revolution, Dr MS Swaminathan, were being awarded the Bharat Ratna - and that he ""saluted"" all three personalities - Mr Kharge wondered how Mr Chaudhary was allowed to speak on the issue.  'Use Discretion Judiciously'  ""Whenever we want to discuss something, you always ask us what rule we should be allowed to do so under. I want to pose the same question to you: under which rule was he (Mr Chaudhary) permitted to speak? If this is the way it is, you should always give us permission as well. On the one hand, you talk about rules, and on the other, you allow whoever you want (to speak),"" Mr Kharge said in Hindi. The Congress chief, who is also the leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, added, ""You have discretion, but you should use that discretion very judiciously, not as and when you want.""  The Rajya Sabha Chairman then interrupted Mr Kharge and said, ""The way your people... When the discussion was going on over giving Chaudhary Charan Singh the Bharat Ratna... I don't want to use words."" Incensed, Mr Kharge thundered, ""Don't make politics (sic). I said we salute all the people who have worked for this country. Irrespective of political parties. Irrespective of caste and creed. We salute them. But the way the discussion is going on, neither are you following the rules nor have you brought that agenda for discussion. We all could have participated."" ""But that was not done. That is not fair. That is not good. If you want to follow, you should follow the rule,"" he said. 'You Have Pained My Heart' After an uproar, Mr Dhankhar retorted, ""Because I come from the farmer community, does not mean I am a weak Chairman. I have tolerated a lot. You say anything you like about me, you don't follow precedent... You use any language against me. Sometimes you behave like a teacher, as if I am a student."" ""This moment is a sensitive one.

Mr Jha made the statement late in the evening, hours after party legislators had reached 5, Deshratna Marg, the official bungalow allotted to Yadav as the deputy chief minister, a post he lost as a result of the latest volte-face by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the JD(U) president. ""Not only MLAs of our party, but even our alliance partners have expressed their wish to be with Tejashwi Yadav till February 12. For us, it is just another date in the calendar but it is definitely causing immense anxiety to those who have achieved power by stealth,"" said the Rajya Sabha MP.  The legislators had begun to reach Mr Yadav's place in the afternoon, where a luncheon was hosted by the younger son and heir apparent of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad ahead of the budget session. By the evening, the visitors were still inside the bungalow and the posse of journalists got piqued upon noticing additional barricades being put up around the sprawling bungalow and personal staff of many an MLA carrying medicines and other belongings. They said they had been told by the employer that there was a meeting which would continue for long.

However, Mr Jha rubbished the allegations, saying ""They seem to be fine with a luncheon where many did not turn up and transporting legislators to far-off Bodh Gaya. Only our MLAs staying in Patna, voluntarily, is a problem"". The allusion was to a luncheon hosted by JD(U) Chief Whip Shravan Kumar and a two-day training workshop in Bodh Gaya which is being attended by all MLAs and MLCs of the BJP. Mr Jha said, ""If you could get a peek inside, you would see all our party colleagues and allies enjoying themselves and playing antakshari to lighten up the mood amid serious discussions on national and state politics"". He added that Tejashwi Yadav had said that the game has just begun. ""He meant to say that it was not us, but Nitish Kumar who broke the alliance, though it was only he who had come to us seeking support two years ago when he felt stifled in the NDA,"" Jha said.

""When Lord Ram resides in the heart, what is the need to take the name? Lord Ram was there earlier too,"" Mr Yadav said during the budget session in the Legislative Assembly. ""Lord Ram is there even today. Lord Ram will always be there. When we were not there, Lord Ram was there, and when we would no longer be, Lord Ram would still be there. Therefore, by saying that you have brought Lord Ram, you are not only insulting Lord Ram, but also the religion,"" he said, asking the BJP to stop doing politics in the name of religion.  Akhilesh Yadav cited the Governor's address to say Rs 31,000 crore was spent on the beautification of Ayodhya ahead of the Ram Temple consecration ceremony. The former UP Chief Minister criticised the ""big budget"" presented by the treasury bench, saying it means nothing if the government chooses to spend it covertly. ""The government does not provide information about how much has been spent of the amount allocated."" He said, ""Whether the UP budget is of Rs 7 lakh crore or Rs 8 lakh crore, the biggest question will always be 'what is in it for the 90 per cent of the people of the state?' The policy of the BJP is not for the common public of the state. It keeps 90 per cent of the budget for the 10 per cent of rich people. And only 10 per cent of the budget for the 90 per cent of the needy people."" The SP chief mentioned in his speech several issues afflicting the state, such as inflation, law and order, unemployment, and farmer distress, and asked the government if there is enough in the budget to address these issues and also asked it to reveal the allocation towards them. ""Will the farmer get the right price for his crop? Whether the income of the farmers be doubled? Will the labourer get the right price for his hard work?"" Mr Yadav asked, and used a Hindi proverb to claim big is not always better - 'Bada hua to kya hua jaise ped khajoor, panchi ko chhaaya nahi, phal lage ati door.' ""India is the fifth (largest) economy in the world, but 80 crore are dependent on government ration. There is no exemption in rail fare for senior citizens. For the youth, there is only four-year Agniveer recruitment in the Army,"" Mr Yadav said.

KB Byju, a former SPG personnel and now a close aide of Mr Gandhi, was questioned for over three hours, and he may be called again although no date has been fixed yet, the police officer said. ""The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' had passed through Jorhat town on January 18, during which there were some problems and a case was registered at Jorhat Sadar police station. We had issued a notice to the accused in the case, and one of them was KB Byju, who appeared before us today,"" he said.  Mr Bjyu reached the police station around 10.20 am and was there till 2 pm.

Besides Bjyu, several other Congress leaders, including state president Bhupen Kumar Borah and working president Rana Goswami, were named in the FIR for allegedly deviating from the yatra's permitted route in Jorhat town on January 18.

(FILE) In a veiled attack on the Congress, DPAP chairman Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday said if the BJP achieves its target of more than 400 seats in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, the party which failed to lead the opposition INDIA block would be responsible for it. The former Congress leader also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for conferring Bharat Ratna on his predecessors PV Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh and said they deserved the honours for their outstanding contribution for the country. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a public meeting at Garkhal in Pragwal near the International Border on the outskirts of Jammu, Mr Azad said, ""I am not an astrologer who could tell whether they (BJP) will cross the 400-mark (in the Lok Sabha polls). If it happens, those who failed to take everyone along will be responsible. I feel they all have teamed up with them."" He was responding to a question about the possibility of the BJP crossing the 400 seat-mark in the upcoming elections and National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah's concern over the health of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA).  ""He (Omar) was a minister in the (A B Vajpayee-led) BJP government. He might have remembered his old loyalty,"" Mr Azad said. Mr Azad, a former chief minister of J&K, said he is neither close to the Congress nor the BJP. ""Let the Congress speak what they want. For me, if the BJP is doing anything wrong I am the first to criticize and likewise if Congress is doing anything right, I am giving credit to them."" Mr Azad, who floated Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP) in September 2022 after resigning from Congress, welcomed the decision of Prime Minister Modi to award Bharat Ratna to Rao and Singh. ""Rao brought Manmohan Singh as his Finance minister when I was Tourism minister in his cabinet. His liberalization policies revolutionized the economy to keep pace with the outside world which was moving ahead of us. I also advocated liberalization policy to end monopoly in air service,"" he said, adding that the liberalization policy introduced by the Rao government is being followed by the Modi government as well. ""Singh was the tallest farmer leader and we have not seen anyone among the farming community to come closer to his stature. Recognizing his contribution for the country will boost the morale of the farming community,"" he said. Mr Azad said he is thankful to the Prime Minister for acknowledging the work of the two leaders in the interest of the nation. ""If any work was done for the benefit of the country, it should be appreciated and if the present government is doing this, we should appreciate it."" On the prevailing situation in Pakistan, the DPAP leader said the free and fair elections in neighbouring countries are a far cry due to the interference of the Army in the electoral process. ""Since the formation of Pakistan, we (India) have had differences with it and Pakistan is responsible for the tension between the two countries. Immediately after independence, Pakistan launched an attack and separated our part which is known as Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Our brothers there are not happy,"" he said. He said while India got democracy and saw a change of Prime Ministers through electoral exercise, they got dictatorship and the army is running the governments there. The public representatives are living at the mercy of the Army which decides who wins or loses.

Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on Saturday said diversity and representation are crucial not only for rectifying historical injustices but also for enriching the decision-making capacity of courts. Speaking on the occasion of the second annual lecture series to mark the first sitting of the Supreme Court on January 28, 1950, Chief Justice Chandrachud welcomed International Court of Justice Judge Hilary Charlesworth as a chief guest of the programme. ""It is important to emphasise that diversity and representation is crucial not only for rectifying historical injustices but also for enriching the decision-making capacity of courts. The evolving representation of nation-states before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has notably challenged its historically monocultural and Eurocentric outlook,"" he said.  ""Likewise, integrating gender diversity within the courts would substantially broaden the spectrum of perspectives, leading to more comprehensive and equitable decisions,"" he said. Emphasising that the top court has made strides in making its provisions gender-inclusive, CJI Chandrachud said, ""The Supreme Court released a sensitisation module for the judiciary on the LGBTQIA+ community, which seeks to sensitise members of the judiciary on concepts of gender and sexual diversity, on the usage of appropriate terminologies and makes recommendations on the protocol to be followed by courts while interacting with the members of the queer community."" He added, that similarly, the top court has last year released a 'handbook to combat gender stereotypes', in an attempt to ensure that judges use inclusive language and consciously avoid the use of stereotypes in decision-making. ""Before 2024, only 12 women had been bestowed with the title of 'Senior Advocate' throughout the entire history of the Supreme Court. However, recently there was a significant shift as the Supreme Court designated 11 women hailing from various regions across the country as Senior Advocates,"" he highlighted. Supreme Court of Singapore Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon was the chief guest for the first edition of the annual lecture series, which was held last year, to celebrate the legacy of the Supreme Court. Justice Surya Kant, who was also present on the dais gave the welcome address. The programme was attended by top court judges, high court judges, senior lawyers, law students and interns. CJI Chandrachud said that the first woman to be elected to the ICJ was Dame Rosalyn Higgins, who also became the first female president of the court and Judge Charlesworth is regarded as one of the pioneers of the feminist approach to international law and has brought this school of thought into the mainstream. He added that Judge Charlesworth, who was his old friend since Harvard Law School days, was the fifth woman to serve on the ICJ in the court's 77-year history. ""Recently, Judge Julia Sebutinde, the first African woman to sit on the ICJ, has been elected as the vice president. To have more women as judges of the International Court of Justice is not the responsibility of the Court alone, but a share of the responsibility must be borne by nation-states and national groups who are responsible for the nomination process. ""I dare say the same in regard to the appointment of more women judicial officers in India as well,"" CJI Chandrachud added. He said that the institution of the Supreme Court of India in 1950, a moment that marked political and social transformation, cannot be viewed as divorced from the political realities of its time. ""The sitting of the Supreme Court for the first time echoed the aspirations of a nascent country burdened by the legacy of colonial rule and entrenched social stratification, yet equipped with a transformative, progressive, and foresighted Constitution. ""Over the years, the Supreme Court has embodied these aspirations by crafting a vast body of jurisprudence aimed at liberating India from its colonial past and fostering the groundwork for social transformation. In this journey, the apex court of the nation has emerged as a product of the interplay between polity, societal aspirations, and the law,"" he highlighted. CJI Chandrachud further said nowadays legal forums across the globe are recognising that they cannot view themselves as divorced from the socio-political realities and aspirations of the time. This recognition fosters an environment conducive to mutual learning and exchange of ideas, the CJI said, adding that he is hopeful that the lawyers and researchers who are being mentored are going to change the way the legal systems have been working in.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-family-planning-in-politics-bjp-welcomes-new-allies-amit-shah-5032262,Akali Dal Back In BJP-Led NDA Alliance? What Amit Shah Said,"The BJP does not believe in ""family planning"" in politics and always welcomes new allies, Union Home Amit Shah asserted on Saturday and said that talks were on with the Shiromani Akali Dal. Speaking at an event, Mr Shah also stressed that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) will be implemented before the Lok Sabha polls and predicted the BJP will win 370 seats while the NDA will get more than 400 seats out of 543 in the elections. Asked about the possibility of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), headed by Jayant Singh, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and other regional parties joining the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the home minister said, ""We believe in family planning (in general) but not in politics.""  ""We always want that our alliance grows and we always welcome new allies. Our ideology has remained the same since the days of Jan Sangh. Those who like to join us can come,"" he said at the ET NOW Global Business Summit 2024. When pressed further on the re-entry of SAD in NDA, he said, ""Talks are going on but nothing has been finalised."" Sukhbir Singh Badal-led SAD had pulled out of the NDA in September 2020 over the now-scrapped three farm laws. On the possibility of joining hands with the TDP, which left the NDA in 2018, or the YSR Congress, Mr Shah said, ""Everything is not disclosed in such platforms. Wait for some time. Everything will be clear for all."" In a major political realignment ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar switched from the opposition INDIA bloc to the NDA last month while there is talk of RLD also joining the BJP-led alliance. Mr Shah said the BJP has never sought separation from any alliance partner and has even let its regional allies lead state governments despite being the bigger partner. He said many ""friends"" have come and many have gone away. ""There are normally two reasons why they leave. It is because of certain incident or it is because of the political equation of a particular state. But the BJP never sought separation from any party. BJP always maintained the coalition dharma,"" Mr Shah said. The Union minister asserted that there is no suspense over the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls and even the Congress and other opposition parties have realised that they will again have to sit in the opposition benches. ""We have abrogated Article 370 (of the Constitution, which gave a special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir). So we believe that the people of the country will bless the BJP with 370 seats and the NDA with over 400 seats,"" Mr Shah said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made a similar prediction about winning a third consecutive term a few days back while speaking in Lok Sabha. Mr Shah said the 2024 polls will not be an election between the NDA and the INDI opposition bloc, but between those who deliver on the promise of development and a bright future and those who give mere slogans and represent hopelessness. Asked about the Bharat Jodo Yatra of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, he said the Nehru-Gandhi scion has no right to go ahead with such a march as his party was responsible for the country's partition in 1947. Now, he said, again some people of the Congress are talking about the division of the country (South India -North India) and the party is not even distancing itself from such statements. On the timing of a white paper tabled by the government in Parliament, Mr Shah said it was necessary as the country has full right to know what mess the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) left behind when it lost power in 2014. ""At that time (2014), the economy was in a bad shape. There were scams everywhere. Foreign investment was not coming. Had we released a white paper at that time, it would have given a wrong message to the world. ""But after 10 years, our government has revived the economy, brought foreign investment and there is no corruption at all. So it is the right time to publish the white paper,"" he said. The home minister said the Congress was scared that their scams since 1948 would come out in the open in the white paper. He claimed that during the two terms of the previous UPA government, there were scams to the tune of Rs 12 lakh crore. On the CAA, Mr Shah said the law, enacted in 2019, will be implemented before the Lok Sabha polls after issuing the rules in this regard. ""Our Muslim brothers are being misled and instigated (against the CAA). The CAA is only meant to give citizenship to those who came to India after facing religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. It is not for snatching anyone's Indian citizenship,"" he said. To a query on a Uniform Civil Code, Mr Shah said it is a constitutional agenda, signed by the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and others. ""But the Congress had ignored it due to appeasement. The enforcement of the UCC in Uttarakhand is a social change. It will be discussed on all forums and face legal scrutiny. ""A secular country cannot have religion-based civil codes,"" he said. About the decision to confer the Bharat Ratna on Chaudhary Charan Singh, former prime minister PV Narasimha Rao and renowned agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan, Mr Shah said all three persons were big institutions of their times. ""In Congress' time, Bharat Ratna was given either due to compulsion or to the family,"" he said. To a query on some leaders, including Uddhav Thackeray, asking why Bharat Ratna was not being given to Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Mr Shah said: ""We have taken note of their suggestion"". The home minister, however, refused to comment on the issues of Gyanvapi mosque and the Shahi Idgah mosque complex in Mathura saying these were now subject matters of courts. Asked about the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, he said: ""The Act is in its place"". The law prohibits conversion of any place of worship and provides for the maintenance of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on the 15th day of August 1947, excluding Ayodhya's Ram Janmabhoomi complex. There has been a demand from a section including some BJP leaders that the law should be scrapped. Mr Shah said it is very unfortunate that there is a debate on the caste of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has a habit of telling lies publicly and repeating those thereafter. Mr Shah also said it was a Congress government in Gujarat that included Modi's caste in the list of Other Backward Classes (OBC) in 1994 and the Centre included the prime minister's caste in its OBC list in 2000.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bangaram-and-thinnakara-islands-becoming-tourism-hotspots-in-lakshadweep-post-pms-visit-5032256,These Lakshadweep Islands Are Becoming Tourism Hotspots After PM Visit,"Lakshadweep's tourism landscape will get major makeover with infra development (Representational) Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the Lakshadweep archipelago and his Bangaram stay has turned the island surrounded by turquoise blue waters, multicolored coral reefs, and a variety of sea life into a tourism hotspot. Not just Bangaram, the nearby Thinnakara island is also benefiting from the attention generated by the PM's visit and India's subsequent diplomatic row with the Maldives over the derogatory comments made by some Maldivian leaders on social media platforms against PM Modi and India. The incident resulted in many calling for a boycott of Maldives as a tourism destination and pushing the island archipelago as a suitable alternative.  The controversy worked in favour of Bangaram and Thinnakara islands which, apart from their beautiful beaches, large lagoons with crystal clear water, and tranquil surroundings, also have a story behind their names. ""The name Thinnakara came from 'Thinna Kara' (a Malayalam word for the land where someone ate food). The story is that a group of warriors of the Chera Kingdom on a boat met with a wreck and took refuge on the island,"" Saifullah, a resident of Agatti, who stays six months on the Thinnakara island to tap the coconut sap for coconut jaggery, told PTI. ""There they found a lot of coconut trees and used the fruits to quench their thirst and hunger,"" he said. ""Bangaram was derived from the word 'Banna Kara' (meaning a land to which people came). These warriors then traveled to Bangaram hoping to find an escape route to the mainland,"" he added. Saifullah, however, doesn't know what happened to those warriors. Apart from the lagoons and the crystal clear waters inhabited by a variety of sea life, there are also remains of a shipwreck near Bangaram, which is now a snorkeling hotspot. ""This shipwreck is said to have happened more than 200 years ago,"" Saifullah said. It could arguably be the only shipwreck ecosystem in the world where one can walk through the sea and see a plethora of sea life. The water in this area, most times of the year, is only chest-deep and one can simply walk to the spot and see a variety of fish using a snorkeling glass. The fish even nibble on biscuits or bread crumbs given by the people. Saifullah said that his father and his great grandfather have talked about the shipwreck during his childhood. ""Earlier, the remains were far from the coast. Now it has moved closer,"" he said. He further said that Bangaram has been a tourism destination for many years. It had a casino on the island and resorts. But all of them were closed down later, probably due to the connectivity issues of Lakshadweep, Saifullah said. Presently, only Alliance Airlines has a single daily flight to Agatti Island, with two trips on Wednesdays and Sundays. Apart from the flight, there is only one ship between Kochi and Kavaratti every week. All that is set to change given the plan to give the island archipelago a major makeover with several big projects in the pipeline, starting with improving the connectivity. Both Bangaram and Thinnakara islands can be reached within 45 minutes on a boat from Agatti if there is no sea turbulence, which has the sole airport in Lakshadweep. Besides the proximity to the only airport in the archipelago, the two islands are also uninhabited, and full of coconut trees and only 15 people live on Thinnakara island for six months when they make coconut jaggery. The Lakshadweep administration operates a five-star resort on Bangaram island and there is nothing else, not even a shop or people who are outsiders. The uninhabited nature of the islands is also an attraction and occasionally tourists staying in Agatti, come to take a stroll on the resort property and go back. The guests staying there, meanwhile, get to enjoy the tranquility, with no outside noise but just the humming of the sea breeze, due to the lack of people. ""This place is one of the most beautiful places in the world. I was here eight years ago and I wanted to show this place to my friends. That's why I have come back,"" Joanna Ambika, an Indian-adopted woman who lives in Sweden told PTI. Swapnil and Jyothi, a couple on their honeymoon trip to Bangaram, also shared a similar view. ""I do not know why Indians prefer to travel to Maldives or Bali when they have the most beautiful place like this in India,"" Swapnil said. He opined that people should travel more to Lakshadweep as it has better facilities, people with great hospitality, and good food. ""I wish if they could add one or more flights for connectivity then it would be great,"" Jyothi said. Bangaram may soon have more properties and a 22-acre resort proposal at Thinnakara by a private team may also come up if it gets disentangled from the litigation it is caught up in. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com If more such facilities are offered on these beaches, the tourism landscape of Lakshadweep is surely going to have a major makeover.

""When we speak of the 500-year-old history, it was that of slavery, of oppression. When we talk of January 22, 2024, we consider that day to be that of the resurgence of spiritual and cultural conscience. This day will be held memorable for several thousands of years,"" Nadda said during a discussion on the Ram Mandir on the last day of the Budget session. Mr Nadda said that people should consider themselves blessed that they got the opportunity to see the Pran Pratishtha of Lord Ram Lalla.  ""This is a moment of pride for all of us that we got the opportunity to see the Pran Pratishtha of Lord Ram Lalla. We have become part and parcel of this historic time. This would not have been possible without God's blessings. So we should be thankful to them,"" the BJP chief said. Mr Nadda said that though it is known that Lord Ram's exile lasted 14 years, given the establishment of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya, it may be said that His exile also lasted for 500 years. ""This was a long struggle for 500 years from 1528 to 2023. So many generations have passed, so much time has gone by, so long as the movement. We say that Lord Ram's exile was for 14 years, but Lord Ram's exile also spanned 500 years. He had to stay in a tent amid all the difficulties. And today, when he is Virajman in his palace, in his temple, this is a historic moment for all of us,"" he said. The BJP president said that people in our country not only worship Lord Ram but also draw inspiration from him. ""Lord Ram is the soul of this country. He is the culture, way of life, and dignity of this country. Apart from worshipping Him as Lord Ram, we also get inspired by Him in our personal and social lives,"" he said. Mr Nadda said that Lord Ram is not only restricted to Sanatana Dharm but is also found in other religions, religious texts, and other countries as well. ""Lord Ram is not only found in Sanatana Dharm. He is found in many religious texts; many religions have accepted Him and many countries have considered Him as their own,"" he said. Citing examples of the prevalence of Lord Ram in other cultures across countries, the BJP president said, ""Lord Ram is in Guru Granth Sahib, in other religions as well. In Thailand, the King is known by the title King Rama, the Tenth."" ""In Indonesia, which is a Muslim-majority country, Ramayan is broadcast every day on television. In South Korea, the queen's Vanshavali also starts with Ram. So we cannot look at Lord Ram from a narrow perspective. We have to look at him in a greater perspective, as our way of life,"" he added. Nadda said that many kings, saints, and nihangs have sacrificed their lives in this 500-year-long struggle whom the House would like to honour. ""In this 500-year struggle, many kings, people, saints, and nihangs have struggled. You have seen our 30-year struggle, which is fresh. In the last 500 years, thousands have lost their lives, thousands have been injured...I would like to honour all of them,"" he said. Hitting out at the opposition, Mr Nadda said, ""When the entire country was together, some saw it in another way which led to delays on multiple occasions...We have seen the firing of bullets, got hit with lathis, went to jail...We have seen Atal's (former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee) speeches and Advani's speeches (former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani)"" The BJP state chief remarked that his party had stated that they stood for the construction of Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya as early as 1989. ""As far as the Bharatiya Janata Party is concerned, in Palampur in 1989, we had stated clearly that we would strengthen the way forward for Lord Ram Lalla's mandir.

JD(U) chief whip Shravan Kumar said those defying the whip ""will lose their membership"" even as he maintained that it was a ""routine exercise that takes place ahead of every assembly session"". ""A whip has been issued, directing MLAs to remain present in the House and vote in favour of the government whenever the occasion arises. It is, however, a routine exercise that we undertake ahead of every assembly session,"" Shravan Kumar told reporters here.  The JD(U) leader, who is also a senior minister in the state cabinet, however, added, ""Of course, defying the whip has consequences. It can result in the MLAs concerned losing their membership. Mr Kumar was speaking on the sidelines of a luncheon he had hosted for party legislators at his residence, where signatures were obtained from the attendees, though a few MLAs remained conspicuous by their absence. He, however, asserted, ""A few of our MLAs could not come because of ill health. They had explained to me their difficulty. Some of them are likely to turn up tomorrow when the legislature party meeting is scheduled at the residence of my cabinet colleague Vijay Kumar Sinha, who holds the parliamentary affairs portfolio. Moreover, all would be inside the House on Monday when the budget session commences. He also rubbished rumours that the chief minister, who is also the party president, had grown upset to see very few MLAs present at the luncheon and had left the minister's residence in a huff. ""The chief minister had engagements elsewhere. So, he came quite early when visitors had only begun to pour in. There is no question of any misgivings. Rumours of cracks in our party ranks and some of our MLAs being in touch with the opposition are baseless,"" asserted Shravan Kumar. He also made light of CPI(ML) leader Mahboob Alam, whose party is a part of the Mahagathbandhan, meeting former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, an NDA ally. ""Political figures do meet each other despite not being on the same side. We must not try to read too much into these things. Jitan Ram Manjhi is firmly with the NDA,"" claimed the JD(U) leader. Notably, Mr Manjhi, whose Hindustani Awam Morcha has four MLAs, including himself, has also issued a whip in what he called an attempt to dispel ""the confusion created by those chasing headlines and TRP"". Meanwhile, RJD MLA and spokesperson Akhtarul Iman Shahin, whose party helms the Mahagathbandhan, took a swipe at the NDA, accusing its constituents of holding MLAs captive (bandhak banaa ke rakh diya hai). ""Our leader Tejashwi Yadav, in his 17 months as deputy chief minister, has endeared himself to the people of Bihar through his emphasis on job creation. A reason why many in the JD(U) and even the BJP are now looking up to him and want to work under his leadership,"" claimed Mr Shahin, who had arrived at Mr Yadav's residence to attend a luncheon for Mahagathbandhan leaders. He said, ""I challenge the NDA to allow its members vote on the basis of their conscience. The government will fall.

Mr Patil also demanded that the state government call a special assembly session in the next two days. ""To implement the draft notification to provide reservations to the Maratha community, given by the state government, it should be made into law in the special assembly session,"" he said. Mr Patil also demanded that the state government start the process of taking back all the cases filed against members of the Maratha community.  Earlier, Mr Patil had on Wednesday announced that he would be going on another indefinite hunger strike from February 10. ""It is much needed to sit on an indefinite hunger strike again. It is the government's responsibility to implement the law for the reservation. This law is very important for the Maratha community,"" Mr Patil had said. He also said that once they get the certificate of reservation, they will hold a Vijay rally, and that day will be celebrated as 'Maha Diwali'. ""This is the first time in the last 70 years that the Maratha Community has had a strong law for the reservation. We had planned to march to Mumbai. When we get the certificate of reservation we will hold a Vijay rally and that day will be celebrated as Maha Diwali,"" he added. Even though the state government issued a draft notification claiming to give the reservation to the Maratha community, Jarange Patil and his community are in doubt after the contradictory statements passed by the leaders. The Maratha community, under the leadership of Jarange Patil, has been seeking reservations in education and jobs under the OBC category. The guarantee of reservation under the Kumbi category however finds objection within the Maharashta government with senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal opposed to it. ""I have been working for the OBCs for the last 35 years. Today Marathas are included in OBC, tomorrow Patels, Jaats and Gurjars will also be included. Strong communities will enter the OBC category this way. We will fight in every manner that can be expected in a democracy. Supreme Court said that Marathas are not backward, but they are being included in OBC through the backdoor entry, this is affecting the OBC reservation,"" Bhujbal had said. Mr Patil had begun his agitation in Vashi, Navi Mumbai, outlining several demands, including Kunbi certificates for all Marathas, free education from kindergarten to postgraduate level, and reservation of seats for Marathas in government job recruitments. Following this, the government issued an ordinance accepting these demands. Meanwhile, Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde claimed that his government would give the reservation to the Maratha community without making any kind of change in other communities' reservations. ""While giving the Maratha reservation, we will keep in mind that whether it is the OBC community or any other community, without making any kind of change in their reservation, we will give the reservation to the Maratha community. Our view from the beginning has been to provide such a reservation that meets the criteria. I have said this openly as Chief Minister, and both our Deputy Chief Ministers have also said the same,"" Mr Shinde had said.

Addressing an annual lecture series organised to commemorate the Supreme Court's diamond jubilee, the CJI said that prior to 2024, only 12 women had been bestowed with the title of senior advocate in the entire history of the Supreme Court. However, recently, there was a significant shift as the Supreme Court designated an equal number of women hailing from various regions across the country as senior advocates.  ""They (female senior advocates) will be the torchbearers of change in the future of the legal profession in our society,"" the CJI said ""There was once a notion of law which limited us to merely an isolated arena from society. Today, legal fora across the globe are recognizing that they cannot view themselves as divorced from the social and political realities and aspirations of the time. This recognition fosters an environment conducive to mutual learning and the exchange of ideas,"" the CJI said. Addressing the gathering, CJI DY Chandrachud shared about his academic journey at Harvard Law School with International Court of Justice judge Hilary Charlesworth. CJI DY Chandrachud said that Justice Charlesworth is an esteemed scholar, a pioneering feminist thinker, and his old friend. At the annual lecture series organised to commemorate the Supreme Court's diamond jubilee, CJI DY Chandrachud said, ""...To have more women as judges of the ICJ is not the responsibility of the court alone but the shared responsibility of nation-states and the national groups involved in the nomination process. I dare say the same in regard of more women in the judicial offices of India as well..."" CJI said that he was reading that in October last year, the ICJ amended, among other documents, its rules of courts and practice directions to make their provisions gender inclusive. The Supreme Court of India has also made strides in this regard. The Supreme Court released a sensitization module for the judiciary on LGBTQIA community, which seeks to sensitize members of the judiciary on concepts of gender and sexual diversity, on the usage of appropriate terminologies, and make recommendations on the protocol to be followed by courts while interacting with the members of the queer community. Similarly, the Supreme Court recently released a handbook to combat gender stereotypes in an attempt to ensure that judges use inclusive language and consciously avoid the use of stereotypes in decision-making. International Court of Justice judge Hilary Charlesworth said that assertions on the judge's independence are always made by someone who is part of international judicial institutions such as the International Court of Justice. Almost all disputes and requests that arrive at the court have a clear political context, and some observers are keen to question the court's ability to resolve such issues on the basis of law, she said. International Court of Justice judge Hilary Charlesworth said, ""And yet, in my view, I think. The Court has largely overall managed to adjudicate the legal aspects of politically sensitive disputes with integrity."" ""Judicial independence is critical to the operation of legal institutions, particularly in volatile political contexts such as the international sphere. But its content is not easy to pin down at the international level, where a diversity of judicial backgrounds is vital. Judicial independence the idea of judicial independence must accommodate intellectual, social, cultural and national differences,"" ICJ judge Hilary Charlesworth said ""I think it's important to develop more sophisticated accounts of judicial independence than simply tracking vote patterns, with all due respect to those who engage in that research. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers has recently identified some current challenges to judicial independence in national legal systems that I think apply also to the international level.

(File) Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday stepped up his attack on the Maharashtra government over the law and order situation in the state by demanding the dismissal of the Eknath Shinde-led dispensation and imposition of the President's rule. He made the demands in the wake of the murder of his party leader Abhishek Ghosalkar (40) at Dahisar in Mumbai two days back. Addressing a press conference here, Mr Thackeray said, ""We demand the dismissal of the Maharashtra government.

Former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on Saturday said he issued a whip asking MLAs of his Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) to vote in favour of the ruling NDA during its confidence vote on February 12. The HAM founder's announcement came shortly after CPI(ML) Liberation legislature party leader Mehboob Alam, a key figure in opposition 'Mahagathbandhan', met Mr Manjhi at his residence, raising many eyebrows. ""All four MLAs of my party will vote in favour of the Nitish Kumar government. Although it was not required, a whip has been issued to dispel the confusion that has been created by those chasing headlines and TRP,"" said Mr Manjhi.  He said the NDA stood consolidated behind the ""towering"" leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and also expressed his gratitude towards Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the JD(U) president, for helping him occupy the state's highest seat of power in 2014. ""I have always been unflinching in my loyalty towards my benefactors, be it Narendra Modi or Nitish Kumar. I parted ways a few months back with Kumar only because of his brusque ultimatum that I either merge my party with his JD(U) or leave"", said Mr Manjhi, recalling his exit from Mahagathbandhan, which he had joined expressing solidarity with the chief minister. Mr Manjhi's son Santosh had to give up his ministerial berth as a result of the party's exit from Mahagathbandhan. Though he is now back in the NDA cabinet, the HAM founder had recently caused a flutter claiming that he had resisted the temptation of the offer of the chief minister's post from the RJD, in exchange for switching over. However, the septuagenarian made it clear that he was not giving the RJD's alleged offer any consideration. ""There is a saying in my village that the neo-rich are more dangerous than the traditional elite. I have no intention of going with them (RJD),"" Mr Manji said. Mr Manjhi, who had quit the JD(U) in 2015 to float HAM, also dismissed rumours of unease in the chief minister's party over the supremo's abrupt return to the NDA and speculations that it could cast a shadow on the trust vote. ""All MLAs of the NDA bloc, be they from JD(U), BJP or HAM, are intact. The alliance enjoys a comfortable majority. It will easily win the trust vote and also elect a new Speaker,"" asserted Mr Manjhi. He also downplayed the visit of Mr Alam, saying ""I am one of the seniormost members of the assembly and, therefore, fellow MLAs do keep dropping in to discuss social and political issues. Do not try to read much into it"". Earlier, Mr Alam had told reporters: ""Manjhi ji is our guardian, a senior leader whom we keep meeting regularly. Of late, he has not been keeping well. So I came and was glad to see that now he is better"". When asked whether they had tea, the Left leader remarked in a jocular vein: ""Yes, we had tea, we also had coffee. Manjhi is in high spirits and he will play a good game"". Notably, ""game"" has become a buzzword in Bihar's political circles ever since RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, who lost the deputy chief minister's post as a result of his boss Nitish Kumar's volte-face, declared that the ""game is still on."" Speculations are rife that Mr Yadav's father Lalu Prasad, the RJD supremo, would put to use his resourcefulness to turn the tables on the NDA during the trust vote.

This move underscores the BJP's focus on garnering support in tribal-dominated areas. The Bhil and Bhilala tribes, with their significant influence across 10-12 districts in western Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat, are at the centre of this strategy. PM Modi is scheduled to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone for development initiatives totalling approximately Rs 7,500 crore.  The focal point of this campaign is a grand janjatiya rally near Gopalpura airstrip in the Bhil-dominated district of Jhabua in western Madhya Pradesh. Preparations are going on to accommodate at least one lakh people. Historically, the Congress party has predominantly won the Ratlam-Jhabua ST seat, securing victory 14 out of 18 elections and by-elections since 1952. However, the BJP has made inroads, winning the seat in 2014 and 2019. The political landscape of this constituency has long been shaped by two prominent Bhil figures. First is Dilip Singh Bhuria, who won the seat five times for the Congress from 1980 to 1996 and once for the BJP in 2014. The other is Kantilal Bhuria, a former Union Minister and state Congress chief, who also won the seat five times for the Congress between 1998 and 2015. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Kantilal Bhuria was defeated by the BJP's first-time MLA Guman Singh Damor by a margin of over 90,000 votes. Despite the BJP winning only three of the eight assembly segments in this constituency during the 2018 state elections, their performance improved in the 2023 state elections, winning four segments and narrowly losing another.

The Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly on Saturday passed the Uttar Pradesh Lift and Escalator Bill, 2024 and Uttar Pradesh Lokayukta and Up-Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2024. Now, registration will be mandatory for installation of lifts and escalators. In the second Bill, a provision has been made to reduce the tenure of the Lokayukta and the Up-Lokayukta from eight years to five years.  Speaking on the lift and escalator Bill, Energy Minister Arvind Kumar Sharma said that after an incident in Noida, MLAs Dhirendra Singh and Pankaj Singh had demanded that a law be made for lifts and escalators. Sharma said that a provision has been made in the Bill that registration will be mandatory for installing lifts and escalators in public. A provision has also been made for immediate information in case of an accident and for insurance and compensation. Once the Bill becomes a law, lifts and escalators cannot be installed without obtaining the approval of the Energy Department. It will be mandatory for the agencies that manufacture and install lifts and escalators and the agencies that maintain them to register with the Directorate of Electrical Safety. It will have to be renewed every five years. It will also have to be tested every year and a fee of Rs 1,500 needs to be deposited for this. A fine will be imposed on the owner or the institution concerned if they fail to get the repairs done and ignore the standards. Describing the Bill as the need of the hour, Sharma also said that states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal and Haryana have their own laws for installing lifts, but there was no such provision for it in Uttar Pradesh. He said that its implementation will not only curb accidents, but will also strengthen the system. BJP member Dhirendra Singh expressed his gratitude to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Energy Minister Sharma for bringing the Bill and said it will prove to be a ""milestone"". However, Samajwadi Party members Dr R K Verma, Amitabh Vajpayee and Kamal Akhtar talked out the ""shortcomings"" of its draft and demanded that it be handed over to a Select Committee. Vajpayee said that it has not been made clear as to who will give the insurance, who will give the compensation and the data of accidents due to lifts so far has not been given.

(File) Former Mumbai NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede has moved the Bombay High Court challenging the Enforcement Directorate's money laundering case against him, claiming that it was a ""counter blast"" to a complaint filed by him against the anti-drug agency's senior official. The ED registered the money laundering case against Mr Wankhede after taking cognisance of a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR in an alleged Rs 25 crore bribe demand from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's family to spare his son Aryan Khan in a drugs case. Mr Wankhede, a 2008-batch Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer of the Customs and Indirect Taxes cadre, in his plea said the ED's case ""smacks of malice and vendetta"".  The petition filed on February 6 through advocates Karan Jain, Sneha Sanap and Aditya Targe sought for the ED case to be quashed and an interim order to be passed granting him protection from any coercive action. Mr Wankhede also sought for the probe being carried out by the ED to be stayed till his petition against the CBI case is heard and decided. Both his petitions (one against the CBI case and the other against the ED case) are likely to come up for hearing on February 15 before a division bench headed by Justice PD Naik. In the CBI case, Mr Wankhede has been granted interim protection from coercive action by the High Court last year. In the petition against the ED case, Mr Wankhede claimed that while the ECIR (enforcement case information report) was registered last year, summons have been issued to some NCB officers now after Wankhede filed a complaint against NCB's Deputy Director General Gyaneshwar Singh last month before a Delhi court seeking action against him under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Mr Wankhede claimed he was constrained to approach the court in Delhi as both the Delhi and Mumbai police had failed to conduct an inquiry into the complaint letters he addressed to them against Singh. A court in Delhi on February 6 had issued notice to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, South West Delhi directing him to submit an action taken report on Mr Wankhede's complaints. Mr Wankhede in his petition filed in the High Court against the ED's case said Mr Singh and few powerful people in power have unleashed all agencies like the CBI, ED and NCB to fix him in some case. ""The ED's case is a counter blast to the complaint filed by the petitioner (Wankhede) against IPS Gyaneshwar in January 2024,"" his plea said. It further alleged that Mr Wankhede had received a call threatening him to withdraw the complaints he has submitted against Mr Singh and resign from his post as IRS officer. Mr Wankhede was booked by the CBI in May last year on charges of seeking Rs 25 crore bribe for not framing Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan in the drugs-on-cruise case. The CBI booked Mr Wankhede and others for alleged criminal conspiracy (120-B IPC), and threat of extortion (388 IPC) besides provisions pertaining to bribery under the Prevention of Corruption Act on a complaint from the NCB. Aryan Khan was arrested in the alleged drug bust case on the Cordelia cruise ship on October 2, 2021. Later, the NCB filed a chargesheet in the drugs-on-cruise case against 14 accused but gave a clean chit to Aryan Khan. The much-hyped case took a twist when an 'independent witness' had claimed in 2021 that Rs 25 crore was demanded by an NCB official and other persons, including a witness Gosavi, to let off Aryan Khan.

Mr Shah asserted that there is no suspense over the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls and even the Congress and other opposition parties have realised that they will again have to sit in the opposition benches. ""We have abrogated Article 370 (of the Constitution, which gave a special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir).

When pressed further on the SAD, he said, ""Talks are going on but nothing has been finalised."" Mr Shah said the 2024 polls will not be an election between the NDA and the INDIA opposition bloc, but between development and those who give mere slogans. Asked about the Bharat Jodo Yatra of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, he said the Nehru-Gandhi scion has no right to go ahead with such a march as his party was responsible for the country's partition in 1947. On the timing of a white paper tabled by the government in Parliament, Mr Shah said it was necessary as the country has full right to know what mess the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) left behind when it lost power in 2014. ""At that time (2014), the economy was in a bad shape. There were scams everywhere. Foreign investment was not coming. Had we taken out a white paper at that time, it would have given a wrong message to the world. ""But after 10 years, our government has revived the economy, brought foreign investment and there is no corruption at all. So it is the right time to publish the white paper,"" he said. On the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the home minister said the people of the country believed for 500-550 years that the temple should be built at the place where Lord Ram was born. ""However, due to the politics of appeasement and citing law and order, the construction of the Ram temple was not allowed,"" he said. On the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Mr Shah said the law, enacted in 2019, will be implemented before the Lok Sabha polls after issuing the rules in this regard. ""Our Muslim brothers are being misled and instigated (against the CAA). The CAA is only meant to give citizenship to those who came to India after facing persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. It is not for snatching anyone's Indian citizenship,"" he said.

Aji died at Mananthavady Medical College where he was admitted following the attack that occurred at around 7.30 am today, they said. CCTV visuals showed the wild elephant fitted with a radio collar damaging the compound wall of a house and attacking the man.  Meanwhile, angered locals staged a flash protest by blocking the Mananthavady-Mysore, Mananthavady-Kozhikode and Thalassery roads. The vehicles of the local MLA and the District police chief were also blocked by the agitators, who raised 'go back' slogans. Kerala Forest Minister A K Saseendran termed as 'shocking' the death of the man and said the frequent news of man-animal conflict coming from Wayanad was a matter of concern. On Friday night a forest wildlife watcher was grievously injured in a tiger attack and he is undergoing treatment, he said. The Minister said more response teams will be sent to the locality and a decision on whether to drive it back into the forest or capture it and take it to the rehabilitation centre, will be taken soon.

Abhishek Ghosalkar, the son of the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader, could not have possibly suspected Noronha's plan as he was led to believe the meeting with Noronha was to mend bridges between them. Mauris 'Bhai', as Noronha was known on social media, was a poker player who received praise for helping the poor during the COVID-19 pandemic. As he became popular due to his philanthropy work, he also became inclined towards politics, which led him to decide on contesting the corporator election.  But there was a problem. The son of the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader didn't want Noronha to contest, and objected to his candidacy publicly. Then, a woman filed a case alleging Noronha had raped her. He was jailed for five months in this case. He suspected Ghosalkar to be the architect of the rape allegation to derail his corporator plan. Eventually, Noronha made the plan to kill Ghosalkar by first winning his trust. Noronha made elaborate plans to send a message that he was no longer interested in the corporator election. This would have made Ghosalkar put down his guard. On the day of the shooting, Noronha had invited Ghosalkar to a Facebook live session under the pretext of extending an olive branch and to tell the public both had become friends. Noronha put up banners of Ghosalkar to pretend he supported the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader's son over his own candidacy. The outcome of Noronha's planning is that Ghosalkar agreed to meet him for the Facebook live session. In the video, both are talking in a friendly way, until Noronha gets up and shoots Ghosalkar. After shooting his rival, Noronha ran to the mezzanine floor at his office and shot himself in the head.

A similar charge and a charge of voluntarily causing hurt were also taken into consideration for sentencing Nadeson Pillai Sockalingam Pillai. He also made the man dress up, head to a barber and shave his beard and head. The convict's two Indian-origin friends, Jay Shawn Fernandez and Jude Prabu Davias Pathy, have also been charged with criminal intimidation.  One of Pillai's friends recorded the humiliating acts against the man, reported TODAY newspaper on Friday. The proceedings against the two were not mentioned in the newspaper. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Andre Chong told the court that the victim had borrowed about SGD400 from Jay and agreed to pay him SGD700 on March 26 last year. However, the victim repaid just SGD200 and Jay continued to inflate the debt, which he estimated to be about SGD6,000 by May 13. That same day, Jay asked Nadeson and Jude to meet him and the victim at a bar in Woodlands. ""Thereafter, Jay told the accused and Jude to accompany him to confront the victim for failing to repay the debt. Jude and the accused agreed,"" DPP Chong said. The trio took turns to physically assault the victim at a bar, with Nadeson hitting the victim's cheek with a bangle. After that, they made the victim march to a warehouse at Woodlands Industrial Estate in northern Singapore, which Jay recorded on his mobile phone. At the warehouse, Jay ordered the victim strip naked. When the victim hesitated, the trio threatened to beat him up again. ""The victim, having been assaulted by the trio shortly before this, was placed in substantial fear by the threat. He complied and removed all his clothing,"" TODAY quoted DPP Chong as saying in the court. The victim was then forced to perform sit-ups, push-ups, jumping jacks and sprints while naked for three to five minutes, which Jay recorded on his phone. He then warned the victim that he would publish the video online if the victim filed a police report. The victim was then ordered by the trio to dress up and accompany them to a barber. There, the barber was asked to shave the victim's head and beard. This incident was also recorded by Jay. The victim made a police report on May 29 and Jay was arrested the same day. Jude was arrested on July 25 and Nadeson remained at large until Jan 24 this year. DPP Chong sought a sentence of six to eight months, noting the three had ""no qualms in seeing through with their threat"" of beating up the victim, having just physically assaulted him earlier. ""The prior physical assault also amplified the force of the threat in the victim's mind, causing him greater fear that he would be beaten up yet again,"" he added. ""The victim's fear would have been further compounded by the context in which the threat was made - at an isolated location, where he was outnumbered by the accused person three to one, without the means to extricate himself."" DPP Ching said that the trio's decision to film the victim ""only served to increase his humiliation"". In his mitigation plea, Nadeson said that he had been drunk then. He also questioned the extent of the victim's injuries from the physical assault and asked if the victim had visited a hospital. ""(The victim) was holding my friend's money and never paid back, but took it to another bar and spent it on the women in the bar,"" Nadeson claimed in court, adding that he felt it was ""unfair"" he was being held in jail while the victim was free. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Nadeson's sentence was backdated to January 24, the date of his arrest. For criminal intimidation, he could have been jailed for up to two years or been fined, or both. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Urging the Centre to expedite its diplomatic efforts in securing the release of fishermen apprehended by Sri Lankan authorities, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin expressed concerns about the increase in attacks on members of the state's fishing community in the region and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and resolve the issue at the earliest. In his letter to Prime Minister Modi, Chief Minister Stalin stated, ""I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the alarming increase in incidents of apprehension of Tamil fishermen and their boats by the Sri Lankan authorities. This issue severely impacts the right to livelihood of these fishermen, as the communities have utilised these fishing waters for generations."" CM Stalin urged Prime Minister Modi to renew the Joint Action Group to resolve fishermen's issues.  He also highlighted a 'significant increase' in the number of fishermen being arrested. ""The traditional fishing waters that Tamil fishermen have relied upon for generations are getting increasingly restricted, making it difficult to sustain their livelihood impacting the economic stability of these communities. This also threatens the cultural and social fabric of the region that revolves around the fishing industry. During 2023, the Sri Lankan navy arrested 243 fishermen and seized 37 boats. However, in the past 28 days alone, 88 fishermen and 12 boats were apprehended in six incidents,"" CM Stalin wrote. He mentioned that a legislation recently passed in Sri Lanka allows the country to nationalise the seized boats, which could drive members of the state's fishing community into penury. ""I had previously addressed you regarding the amendment made to the Fisheries Act by the Government of Sri Lanka in 2018, which enables the Sri Lankan Government to nationalise foreign fishing vessels. Due to this action of Sri Lanka, the seized fishing boats of our fishermen that are in good condition cannot be salvaged and brought back to Tamil Nadu. Many fishermen have invested their life savings in acquiring and maintaining their boats, which are vital for their trade,"" he wrote while urging the Sri Lankan government to make necessary amendments to the law.

Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday trained his guns on Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for not releasing to the state Rs 5,300 crore for the Upper Bhadra project announced in the union budget and the Rs 11,495 crore special grants recommended by the 15th Finance Commission. Days after staging a demonstration in New Delhi against the alleged apathetic attitude of the Centre in distributing funds to Karnataka, Siddaramaiah on Friday questioned Sitharaman's sense of responsibility towards Karnataka as a Rajya Sabha member from the state. Speaking to reporters, the chief minister recalled that Ms Sitharaman had said in last year's budget that Rs 5,300 crore would be given for the Upper Bhadra project by March 2024.  ""It was not just a statement somewhere but a commitment made in her (Ms Sitharaman) budget speech. After announcing Rs 5,300 crore for the Upper Bhadra project, she did not give us even a rupee till date,"" he claimed. Pointing out that the state government has spent Rs 2,435 crore on the project this fiscal, he said that out of the total of Rs 8,000 crore funds pumped into the project so far, Karnataka's share is about Rs 6,000 crore. The Upper Bhadra project is a major lift irrigation scheme under implementation in the central region of Karnataka. It envisages lifting up to 17.40 TMC of water in the first stage from the Tunga to the Bhadra river and lifting 29.90 TMC of water in the second stage from the Bhadra to a tunnel near Ajjampura in the Tungabhadra sub-basin of Krishna basin. The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs 21,473.67 crore. Asserting that the Centre's injustice should anger Kannadigas, the chief minister said, ""Once it is mentioned in the budget, the Centre should release it. And she (Sitharaman) is representing Karnataka as a Rajya Sabha member. Doesn't she have the responsibility after announcing Rs 5,300 crore for Upper Bhadra?"" He also said that Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar had met Union Water Resource Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and insisted upon the release of funds, but to no avail. Furthermore, Siddaramaiah said that the finance minister had rejected the 15th Finance Commission's recommendation on special grants. ""The 15th Finance Commission had recommended special grants; one was Rs 5,495 crore and another was 6,000 crore. Both put together was Rs 11,495 crore. But we did not get even a rupee of it. It was rejected by Nirmala Sitharaman. Is it not an injustice?,"" the chief minister asked. When he was asked whether the state was planning to approach the Supreme Court, Siddaramaiah said he had not thought of it yet, but characterised what happened as injustice. ""But it is true that injustice has happened because for each Rs 100 tax collected by us for the Centre, we get only Rs 12 to Rs 13 in return while Rs 87 or Rs 88 goes to Centre,"" Siddaramaiah explained. He said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was Gujarat Chief Minister, he had once said that the Centre should directly collect taxes from the people of the state instead of recovering the tax revenue from the state administration. ""Now he (Modi) says that we are dividing India. What should we call him for his previous statement (as Gujarat CM)?,"" Siddaramaiah wondered aloud. He pointed out that when the BJP's Basavaraj Bommai was chief minister, his 2023-24 budget had reiterated that the state would get Rs 5,300 crore because Nirmala Sitharaman had said so during the union budget speech. Bommai had also said that the Upper Bhadra project would be declared a national project. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com ""Did they (BJP) do it?

Ahead of the by-election, Shivpal merged his party, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), with the SP and came out in strong support of Akhilesh Yadav. Terming this year's budget presented by the finance minister as ""fraud"", Shivpal said the budget should have been beneficial, inclusive and effective. On the inauguration of the Ram Temple, Shivpal said, ""It is a good thing that the consecration ceremony of Lord Ram was organised but the Ram temple is just a stopover."" ""The goal should be to establish Ram rajya. I wish you would have presented a budget that that a vision for converting the entire state into Ayodhya's Ram rajya.""

Uttar Pradesh Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna has presented a budget in the state assembly with an outlay of Rs 7.36 lakh crore in the Assembly on Monday for the financial year 2024-25. Members of the ruling party said that in the previous governments, Uttar Pradesh was in the category of ""Bimaru"" (sick) states, but the ""double-engine"" government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has changed it. Praising the budget, senior BJP leader Anupama Jaiswal said that the state government has taken decisions in the interest of farmers by realising the vision of 'antyodaya'. ""This budget is not a fraud, there is only an opportunity in it,"" she said. BJP's Piyush Ranjan Nishad said it is a public welfare budget that will fulfil the dreams of poor farmers, youth and women. Nishad said PM Modi and CM Adityanath have changed the face of the state.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday called for shoring up engagement among countries of Indian Ocean region to confront challenges like safeguarding sovereignty, dealing with cases of disregard to maritime laws and flouting of long-standing pacts, in remarks seen as an oblique reference to China's military assertiveness including along the Line of Actual Control. In an address at the seventh Indian Ocean Conference in Perth, he also flagged concerns over unsustainable debt, opaque lending practices, unviable projects and ""injudicious"" choices, in thinly veiled comments that came amid concerns over many countries falling into the Chinese 'debt trap'. ""As we gaze at the Indian Ocean, the challenges besetting the world are on full display there. At one extremity, we see conflict, threats to maritime traffic, piracy and terrorism,"" Mr Jaishankar said.  ""At the other, there are challenges to international law, concerns about freedom of navigation and overflights, and of safeguarding of sovereignty and of independence. Any disregard for arduously negotiated regimes like UNCLOS 1982 is naturally disturbing,"" he asserted. ""In between, a range of trans-national and non-traditional threats present themselves, largely visible in a spectrum of interconnected illegal activities. Instability also increases when long-standing agreements are no longer observed, with no credible justification to justify a change of stance,"" the minister added. Mr Jaishankar said: ""All of them, separately and together, make it imperative that there be greater consultation and cooperation, among the states of the Indian Ocean."" His remarks on non-observance of long-standing agreements without credible justification came against the backdrop of the lingering eastern Ladakh border row that was triggered by China's amassing of a large number of troops along the LAC in the region in violation of existing pacts between the two sides. In his address, Mr Jaishankar also referred to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982. India and a number of other countries including ASEAN member states have been calling for implementation of the UNCLOS, especially in the South China Sea. There has been growing global concerns over China's military offensive in the South China Sea. Mr Jaishankar also talked about ""disruptive"" events saying they are occurring with greater frequency and deeper impact. ""There are also the consequences of distant happenings, such as the fuel, food and fertilizer crises that many of us have experienced,"" he said. ""But we should be equally conscious that the 'normal' can be manipulated, leading to unsustainable debt, opaque lending practices, unviable projects and injudicious choices,"" he said. ""Similarly, there are the complexities of dual purpose agendas that mask visibility and lower our guard. Indeed, such activities when combined with the advancement of connectivity with strategic intent, has emerged as a growing anxiety for Indian Ocean states,"" Mr Jaishankar noted. He said it is necessary to develop awareness and proper understanding of the challenges. ""Our very concept of security has undergone a metamorphosis in a volatile and uncertain existence. As a result, the nations of the Indian Ocean today need to reflect on whether they should pursue more collective self-reliance, or remain as vulnerable as in the past,"" he said. ""Our sustainable future lies in concentrating on the drivers of the future: digital, electric mobility, green hydrogen and green shipping, to cite a few,"" he said. Mr Jaishankar also called for deeper cooperation among like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific region. ""While infusing more energy into the Indian Ocean centric bodies, we also need to simultaneously work on the larger Indo-Pacific canvas and the narrower sub-regional ones. At the end of the day, they all reinforce each other,"" he said. Mr Jaishankar also drew attention to the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), proposed by India in 2019. ""It is an open, non-treaty based global initiative that seeks to manage, conserve, sustain, and secure the maritime domain,"" he said. ""In the IPOI, Australia's leadership on Maritime Ecology, the UK's on maritime security, and the co-leadership of France and Indonesia on the Maritime Resources pillars have helped to make a beginning,"" he added.

The Upper House also cleared The Jammu and Kashmir Local Bodies Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2024 by voice vote.  The Lok Sabha had cleared the bills earlier this week. The Jammu and Kashmir Local Bodies Laws (Amendment) Bill-2024 seeks to provide reservation to Other Backward Classes in panchayats and municipalities in Jammu and Kashmir and bring consistency in the local body laws of the Union territory with the provisions of the Constitution. Currently, there is no provision for reservation of seats for OBCs in panchayats and municipalities in Jammu and Kashmir. The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2024, adds Valmiki community as a synonym of Chura, Balmiki, Bhangi, and Mehtar communities in the list of Scheduled Castes in Jammu and Kashmir.

The three bills were taken simultaneously for discussion and passage in the Upper House. Replying to the discussion on the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2024, Minister of Tribal Affairs Arjun Munda said the bill seeks to give justice to the communities who were demanding ST status for long.

Replying to the Jammu and Kashmir Local Bodies laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityananda Rai said the government has taken several steps for the welfare of the OBCs in the Union territory and this amendment is another step in that direction. There are three main amendments to the bill. Firstly, the bill ensures reservation for OBCs in panchayats and municipal bodies in Jammu and Kashmir. Secondly, the state election commission will be in-charge of conducting elections to panchayats and municipalities, he said. Thirdly, the removal process of state election commissioner will be according to the constitutional provisions and can only be removed under circumstances similar to those of a judge of a high court, Rai added. He also listed out the development works undertaken after removal of Article 370 in the union territory and said Jammu & Kashmir is now peaceful and on the path of development. Rai said incidents of terrorist activities and stone pelting have come down.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said his government could have brought a white paper on economy in 2014 itself when it came to power but he chose 'rashtraneeti' over 'rajneeti' as he did not want to shake the country's confidence. The document has been introduced in the last Parliament session before the general elections. Prime Minister Modi-led government on Thursday brought a white paper tearing into Congress-led UPA rule and saying that it had turned the Indian economy into a non-performing one through indiscriminate revenue expenditure, off budget borrowings and pile of bad debts at banks.  Addressing the Times Groups' ET NOW Global Business Summit, PM Modi said that in the decade before 2014, the policies on which the country was running was taking the country on the path of bankruptcy. ""On this, we have tabled a white paper on the economy in Parliament,"" he said. ""The discussion on it is ongoing. Since there is such a big audience, I would like to state my 'Mann ki Baat' also that the white paper that I have brought now, I could have brought in 2014. If my aim had been to derive political gain, then I would have kept those figures before the people 10 years ago,"" PM Modi said. ""When things came before me in 2014, I was stunned. The economy was in a critical situation. Due to scams and policy paralysis, there was widespread pessimism among global investors. If I would have brought these things to light, if a wrong signal would have gone, probably the country would have lost its confidence in the country like when a patient gets to know that he has a serious disease, he panics, and the country would have felt like that,"" the prime minister said. PM Modi said that bringing the white paper in 2014 would have suited him politically. ""'Rajniti' tells me to do that but 'Rashtraneeti' does not allow me to do that and, therefore, I chose 'rashtraneeti' over 'rajneeti'. And when the situation has become strong in 10 years and we can sustain any assault, then I thought I should tell the truth to the people and that is why I released white paper in Parliament,"" he said. ""When you look at it, you will know where we were and from what situation we have risen and reached here. Now you are seeing the new height of development,"" PM Modi said.

(Representational) The Calcutta High Court on Friday absolved a doctor, who performed the medical termination of pregnancy of a rape survivor, of any deliberate violation of its order to perform an examination only. Expressing displeasure at the medical termination of pregnancy of the woman by a team of doctors, the court had on February 3 sought an explanation from them as to why it was done despite an order to only form a medical board for ascertaining the pros and cons of doing so. A report was filed before the court on Friday by the doctor who was in charge of the checkup of the petitioner.  Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya noted that as per the report, in view of the petitioner's tremendous labour pain and severe bleeding during the examination, the doctor was compelled, in order to give relief to the patient, to carry out the medical termination process immediately. ""Keeping in view the humanitarian aspect of the matter and since the doctor did the right thing in seeking to alleviate the pain of the patient, that is, the petitioner, I do not find that any contemptuous act or deliberate violation of the order or dignity of the court has been done,"" the judge observed. Justice Bhattacharyya had on January 29 directed the West Bengal government to form a medical board to examine the condition of the rape survivor who wanted to terminate her pregnancy caused by the incident and file a report before the court on February 2. A report filed by the West Bengal government on February 2 had said that the pregnancy has already been terminated, leading to the court calling for an explanation from the doctors.

Haryana Director General of Police Shatrujeet Kapur warned of taking strict action if anybody disrupts peace and also appealed to people to maintain peace in the wake of farmers' Delhi march. The police have asked the farmers not to participate without permission in a planned march next week and have also warned of strict action if they damage public property, police said.  Meanwhile, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher criticized the Haryana government, alleging that police was ""raiding"" the houses of farmer leaders and allegedly threatening them. He further said the Punjab-Haryana border was being sealed like an international border. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha and the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha had announced 'Delhi Chalo' march by more than 200 farmers' unions on February 13 to press the Centre for accepting several demands, including enactment of a law to guarantee a minimum support price (MSP) for crops. However, the SKM, which had spearheaded the 2020 farmers' stir against the now-repealed farm laws, was not part of the 'Delhi Chalo' march call. It has already given a call for 'bandh' on February 16. A three-member team of Union ministers on Thursday evening held a detailed discussion here with the leaders of farmer organisations. After the meeting, the farmer leaders said the Central ministers have assured them that they would hold a second round of the meeting soon. However, the farmer leaders said their proposed 'Delhi Chalo' march on February 13 still stands.

Home Minister Anil Vij said the Haryana Police have made fool proof arrangements and nobody will be allowed to disturb peace in the state. ""We will ensure complete peace in our state and will not let it be disrupted in any way,"" added Mr Vij. Haryana DGP Kapur, in his post on X, said people should maintain peace and tranquility and strict action will be taken against those who disrupt peace. He also said rumours should not be spread in social media. Besides making elaborate security arrangements, the Haryana Police will seal the state's borders with Punjab to prevent the farmers from heading towards the national capital, officials said. The farmers have planned to head to Delhi from the Ambala-Shambhu border, Khanauri-Jind and the Dabwali border. The police have already stocked up concrete blocks, barbed wire, sandbags, barricades and other items at the Shambhu border in Ambala to stop the protesters from marching towards the national capital. A senior police official in Jind district told PTI on Friday that they have arranged barbed wire, containers, barricades and concrete blocks etc and will seal the entry point from Punjab. The police official said the sarpanches in nearby villages have held their meetings and have assured the authorities that they will not be participating in the march. In Ambala, Inspector General of Police (Ambala range) Siwas Kaviraj, Superintendent of Police Jashandeep Singh Randhava and Ambala Deputy Commissioner Dr Shaleen visited Haryana-Punjab border near Shambhu toll plaza and assessed the security arrangements there. The police directed petrol pump dealers in Ambala not to give fuel to those who were sporting farmer's union flags on their vehicles. Water cannon vehicles and drone have been deployed at the Shambhu border, officials said. Meanwhile, the farmer unions in Ambala have also been making preparations for the 'Delhi Chalo' march. They have been conducting meetings in various villages and have also been arranging food items to carry along with them while marching toward Delhi. The Ambala district magistrate has imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in the district. The district administration has written to 400 village 'Sarpanches', persuading them not to participate in the agitation. Besides a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP), the farmers are also demanding implementation of the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations, pensions for farmers and farm labourers, farm debt waiver, withdrawal of police cases and ""justice"" for victims of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.

With sticks and brooms in their hands, local women took out processions in different areas of Sandeshkhali as the protest intensified on the second day.

(Representational) After getting elected by the people through a political party or political alliance, a person cannot change his stand against that political party or alliance without getting a fresh mandate from the electorate, the Kerala High Court has said, in a verdict that could have far-reaching implications. The court made the observation while dismissing a petition connected with defection in one of the local self government bodies in Idukki district. Justice PV Kunhikrishnan, in an order issued on February 5, said an elected representative should be the voice of the people of that constituency and cannot go against the will of the electorate and act according to his whims and fancies.  ""After getting elected by the people through a political party or political alliance, a person cannot give up the political party and political alliance and act in accordance with his whims and fancies because the people elected him through a political party or political alliance. ""If he is an independent candidate, supported by a political party or political alliance, he is bound to follow the mandate of the electorate,"" the court said. The court was hearing a matter in connection with a defection case from Adimali Grama Panchayat in Idukki district. The court was considering multiple petitions including a plea against condoning the delay in filing the election petition in that matter. The court said that once a person is elected through the mandate of the electorate under the banner of a political party or political alliance, he must see that the intention of the electorate is spoken out by him in the council or other elected bodies. The court, however, noted that this principle may not be applicable in a case where the candidate himself is an independent contestant without the backing of any political party or political alliance. ""Lord Acton, an English Catholic historian, politician, and writer said that, 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely'. The elected members of a democracy should hear these words before they do anything. Their remote control is the electorate which includes poor daily wage workers, sweepers etc,"" the court observed. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The court said the intention of the defection law itself is to see that the will of the people is exhibited by the elected member till he/she again faces a mandate from the electorate.

Supriya Sule, an MP of the Nationalist Congress Party - Sharadchandra Pawar, on Friday alleged that apps like Google Pay and Phone Pe are ""two ticking time bombs"" and sought to know what steps the government is taking to check money laundering. Participating in a discussion on 'The White Paper on Indian economy' in Lok Sabha, Ms Sule said whatever happened in Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL) is ""very alarming"" and is almost like money laundering. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last month directed PPBL to stop accepting deposits or top-ups in customer accounts, wallets, FASTags and other instruments after February 29.

Mr Hansdak said a white paper should be brought on the misuse of central agencies. ""Their (BJP) government is running because of ED. Otherwise, they won't be able to win elections,"" Mr Hansdak, who represents the Rajmahal constituency of Jharkhand in the Lok Sabha, said. BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal said the corruption seen in the 10 years of UPA government was unprecedented. During UPA's tenure, people would take loans and forget about returning it, he said. Participating in the debate, Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM) said the white paper is more rhetoric than substance. He urged the government to explain why average growth was higher, at 6.8 per cent, during the 10 years of UPA while it is 5.9 per cent during the NDA period. In case of fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP, the average was 4.7 per cent during UPA rule, but it is 5.1 per cent under the 10 years of NDA, he said. Average inflation rate was 8 per cent, which came down to 5 per cent during the NDA government that came to power in 2014. Mr Owaisi also said the NDA government got the benefit of favourable crude oil prices and urged the government to tell the country how demonetisation adversely impacted the country's poor.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/anti-cheating-bill-passed-in-parliament-5026201,Anti-Cheating Bill Passed In Parliament,"Union minister Jitendra Singh asserted that merit cannot allowed to be hijacked by non-merit. Parliament on Friday passed a landmark bill that aims to curb malpractices and irregularities in competitive examinations by including stringent punitive provisions, with Union Minister Jitendra Singh asserting that the bill is meant to deter those who play with the future of the youth. The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill, 2024, passed in Rajya Sabha, has provisions for a maximum jail term of 10 years and a fine up to Rs 1 crore. The bill was passed through a voice vote in Rajya Sabha on Friday, after amendments proposed by some opposition members were rejected. The bill was passed by Lok Sabha on February 6.  Replying to a discussion on the bill in Rajya Sabha, Singh, Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, said the youth power of the country is ""vital"" and made it clear that the bill is meant to deter those who are playing with their future. ""We can't allow vital youth power of this country to be surrendered or sacrificed in the hands of a handful few,"" he said. The minister said students, examinees and candidates will not be under the purview of the legislation. ""Very cautiously, we have kept the bona fide candidates out of the purview of the law, be it a job aspirant or a student. So the message does not go that this new legislation is meant to harass the youth of this country. It is only meant to deter those who are playing with their future and thereby the future of the nation,"" Singh said. The minister went on to say that merit cannot allowed to be hijacked by non-merit and urged the upper House to support the bill in one voice. Singh said the government under Prime Minister Modi has ""walked the talk"" in bringing youth-centric reforms over the last 10 years. The British era practice of attestation of documents by gazetted officers was abolished within months of Modi taking charge in 2014, he said, citing several progressive measures taken by the government. ""This is a bill which is possibly the first of its kind in the history of Indian parliament. And I don't blame the predecessors, maybe the founding fathers of the Constitution... ""Did not visualise such a situation happening, where we would be confronted with an issue which is ruining the future of the children... which is sacrificing the youth energy and youth power at the altar of handful of selfish interest and at a time when we have such a huge stake in our youth, who we call the architects of new India and who will also be determining the face of India in 2047,"" he said. The bill proposes a high-level national technical committee on public examinations that will make recommendations to make the computerised examination process more secure. The move comes against the backdrop of cancellation of a series of competitive tests such as the teacher recruitment exam in Rajasthan, Common Eligibility Test (CET) for Group-D posts in Haryana, recruitment exam for junior clerks in Gujarat and constable recruitment examination in Bihar following question paper leaks. The committee shall look into developing protocols for insulating digital platforms, devising ways and means for developing foolproof IT security systems, ensuring electronic surveillance of examination centres and formulating national standards and services for both IT and physical infrastructure to be deployed for conduct of such examinations. In many instances, it has been observed that organised groups and mafia elements involved in malpractices deploy solver gangs, use impersonation methods and indulge in paper leaks. The bill primarily aims to deter such nefarious elements. The objective of the bill is to bring in greater transparency, fairness and credibility to the public examination systems and to reassure the youth that their sincere and genuine efforts will be fairly rewarded and their future is safe. Opposition parties Congress and Trinamool Congress supported the bill in the Upper House but called for more stringent norms and strict implementation of measures to prevent incidence of paper leaks, cheating and other malpractices.

(File) The shoe of corruption is now on the other foot in Karnataka. A contractors' body which had alleged that 40% commission had to be paid to get contracts for public projects under the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government has levelled the same allegation at the Congress government which came to power last year, but with a twist. The association has said that instead of politicians making money, it is bureaucrats who are doing so now. While the BJP has used the opportunity to attack the Congress, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has said the contractors' body must present proof.  The association's allegations in 2022 had led to the Congress terming the BJP regime in the state a '40% sarkara' (40% government). The party also launched a 'PayCM' campaign with a QR code leading to a '40% sarkara' website, which alleged that the BJP government was charging 40% commission on public projects. The allegations had played a key role in the Congress storming back to power in Karnataka in May last year, winning 135 of 224 Assembly seats. The claims against the Congress government have come just weeks ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. D Kempanna, President, Karnataka State Contractors' Association, who had complained about corruption in the BJP government, said, ""I don't think corruption has come down. Now, officials are making money. Earlier, politicians were."" Other members of the association alleged that officials don't issue work orders or release money unless bribes are paid and also claimed that ""package deals"" are awarded to agencies close to the bureaucrats, ignoring local contractors. Reacting to the allegations, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah asked Mr Kempanna to approach Justice Nagamohan Das Commission if he has documents to prove corruption. ""We constituted the Justice Nagamohan Das Commission to probe '40 per cent commission' that happened in the previous (BJP) government. If he has documents then he must share them,"" Siddaramaiah said, according to news agency PTI. Karnataka Industries Minister MB Patil said, ""Let him (Mr Kempanna) state the departments... present facts against Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (Bengaluru municipal corporation) or the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board... and not make general statements. If there is anything, the chief minister will inquire into it.""

In the midst of global economic transitions, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman unveiled the Interim Budget for 2024-25, outlining a comprehensive fiscal plan that maintains stability in the tax regime while promoting growth across a diverse range of sectors. The budget refrains from altering direct and indirect taxes, signalling a continuity that businesses and taxpayers have been anticipating.  The government has earmarked a total expenditure of Rs 47.66 lakh crore, a 6.1% increase over the previous year's revised estimates. A key highlight is the rise in capital expenditure to Rs 11.1 lakh crore, reflecting the government's commitment to bolstering the nation's infrastructure.   Total receipts, excluding borrowings, are projected at Rs 27.56 lakh crore, with the revised estimate showcasing a revenue receipt of Rs 30.03 lakh crore, indicative of economic momentum and a trend towards formalization.    A significant portion of the budget is directed towards central sector schemes and centrally sponsored schemes, with the Ministry of Defence, Road Transport & Highways, and Railways being the top recipients. These allocations account for 54% of the total expenditure.   For the fiscal year 2024-25, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) receives the top allocation, matching its previous year's revised estimate at Rs 86,000 crore. This maintains the level from 2023-24, which saw an estimated 43% increase in the scheme's funding compared to its initial budget. Following closely, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana secures the second-highest funding for 2024-25 at Rs 80,671 crore. This marks a substantial 49.1% rise from its revised estimate in the previous year. The expenditure for this scheme in 2023-24 was projected to be 32% lower than the budget estimates, primarily due to underperformance in its rural segment. The 2024-25 allocation for this scheme aligns closely with its budget estimate for 2023-24.    The fiscal deficit is budgeted at 5.1% of GDP, a decrease from the previous fiscal's 5.8%, aligning with the government's objective to bring it down to 4.5% by 2025-26.   The focus remains on reducing the revenue deficit to 2% of GDP, down from 2.8%, with an overarching goal to strengthen fiscal responsibility and budget management.   7. Allocation Of National Tax Revenues To States For FY 2024-25: An 8.4% increase in transfers to states is outlined, with a total allocation of Rs 22.74 lakh crore, which includes devolution from the central tax pool, grants, and loans for capital expenditure.   The top 13 ministries in terms of allocations account for 54% of the estimated total expenditure. Of these, the Ministry of Defence has the highest allocation in 2024-25, at Rs 6,21,541 crore. It accounts for 13% of the total budgeted expenditure of the central government. Strategic funding allocations reflect the government's priorities, with the highest being directed towards the Defence Ministry, followed by allocations to enhance transport infrastructure and food and public distribution systems. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com   In 2024-25, funding for programs dedicated to the welfare of women and children has seen a significant rise to Rs 4,19,183 crore, marking an 18.6% increase from the revised estimate of the previous fiscal year, 2023-24. This increased funding spans across various ministries. A notable factor in the augmented allocation for women's welfare is the enhanced support for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. This scheme mandates that the house must be owned or co-owned by the female head of the family. Furthermore, the welfare of children is set to receive a boost, primarily through increased funding for school education.    Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Namibian cheetah Shaurya died due to septicemia, making it the fourth big cat to have died due to this condition, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav informed the Rajya Sabha . Shaurya died at the Kuno National Park (KNP) in Madhya Pradesh on January 16 marking the 10th such fatality since the reintroduction of African big cats in India in 2022. Three cheetahs -- a female named Tbilisi (from Namibia) and two South African males Tejas and Sooraj -- had died due to septicemia last year.  ""This condition arose from wounds beneath their dense winter coat on the back and neck regions, which became infested with maggots and subsequently led to septicemia,"" the environment ministry had said in the annual report on Project Cheetah last year. It was not clear if Shaurya died the same way. Yadav told the Upper House on Thursday that depending upon the availability of animals and the status of the introduced cheetahs, 12-14 animals are proposed to be brought from South Africa and Namibia or other African countries during the next five years. He said that action has been initiated for the introduction of cheetahs in the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh. Yadav informed the Upper House that seven of the 20 adult cheetahs brought from South Africa and Namibia and three of the 11 cubs born in India have died. Seven of the 11 cubs were born last month. According to officials, one of the biggest challenges faced in the first year of managing the cheetahs in India was the unexpected development of winter coats by some of the animals during the Indian summer and monsoon, in anticipation of the African winter (June to September). The winter coat, combined with high humidity and temperatures, caused itching, prompting the animals to scratch their necks on tree trunks or the ground. This led to bruising and exposing the skin, where flies laid eggs, resulting in maggot infestations and, ultimately, bacterial infections and septicemia, leading to the deaths of three cheetahs, an official explained. India plans to import cheetahs that do not develop thicker winter coats, a senior official had told PTI earlier. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com For the cheetahs already in Kuno, the official had said the plan is to administer prophylactic medicine before the arrival of monsoon to prevent infection.

A posthumous Bharat Ratna for ex-Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh has all but redrawn political battle-lines in Uttar Pradesh weeks before a general election, with the Rashtriya Lok Dal seen as on the verge of dumping the Samajwadi Party (and INDIA) to ally with the Bharatiya Janata Party. The award - announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on X - comes amid reports of a deal between the BJP and RLD, which was founded by Charan Singh's son and is now led by his grandson. In fact, sources this week told NDTV the RLD wanted the recognition as part of its terms to come on-board. Party boss Jayant Chaudhary's latest comments seemed to emphasise just that - the deal is done.  ""What previous governments could not do was today completed by PM Modi's vision. I would like to once again express my gratitude to PM Modi's government for encouraging people who aren't part of the mainstream. It is a big day... and an emotional moment for me,"" Mr Chaudhary said. ""I want to thank President (Droupadi Murmu), the (BJP) government, and PM Modi... three (Bharat Ratna) awards have been given. Sentiments of the people are connected with this decision."" Earlier in the day - in fact 13 minutes after Mr Modi tweeted - Mr Chaudhary reposted the Prime Minister's message and declared, ""Dil jeet liya (Hearts have been won)."" दिल जीत लिया! #BharatRatnahttps://t.co/Ns0CraJ7yI But, asked if this meant he will now ally with the BJP, he said, ""Koi kasar rehti hai? Aaj main kis muh se inkaar karoon aapke sawalon ko"", or, ""Is there anything left? How can do I deny your questions today?' And, in the best traditions of Indian politics, Mr Chaudhary refused to burn (for now) the bridge with Samajwadi Party boss Akhilesh Yadav, who continues, for now, to back his RLD counterpart. ""Talking about seats (with the BJP) or votes will make this day less important... when I am congratulating PM Modi... (this) proves he understands the sentiments and character of the nation."" Sources said the BJP will give the RLD - which has substantial support among Jats and farmers in western UP - two Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat in return for its support. For the BJP (for any party, in fact, looking to form the government at the centre), UP is crucial since it has 80 seats.

Seven of those were reserved for the RLD as part of last month's deal with the Samajwadi Party. READ | Samajwadi Party, RLD Form Alliance Ahead Of Lok Sabha Polls The RLD-BJP talks, officially a 'rumour' till confirmed, will probably have Akhilesh Yadav and the INDIA bloc on edge. For Mr Yadav the loss will have reduce his (already slim, based on previous elections) chances of defeating the BJP. And for INDIA, it will mean the loss of a second member to Mr Modi. Mr Yadav, while welcoming the Bharat Ratna for Chaudhary Charan Singh, has refused to comment on the RLD's possible breakaway, telling reporters this afternoon, ""There have been no talks. Whatever it is, (it) is being published in newspapers... am getting information through you."" #WATCH | Lucknow: On speculations of Jayant Chaudhary-led RLD joining the BJP-led alliance in UP, Samajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav says, ""There have been no talks here. Whatever it is, is being published in newspapers, I am getting all the information through you."" pic.twitter.com/8Hfb3vkAa2 Yesterday he called Jayant Chaudhary a ""very well-educated person... (one who) understands politics"". The former UP Chief Minister also said he hoped he would not weaken the struggle against the BJP ""for the welfare of farmers and prosperity of the state"". His party was more explicit; General Secretary Shivpal Yadav said ""Jayant will not go anywhere"", and accused the BJP of ""spreading confusion"". If the RLD does cross over to the BJP - the most likely scenario at this time - it underscores the BJP's determination to throw its political dragnet far and wide before the Lok Sabha election, with the focus on regional parties to shore up its strength in key states.

The Supreme Court on Friday questioned whether the Preamble of the Constitution could be amended while keeping the date of adoption, November 26, 1949, intact. A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta posed the question to former Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy and lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain, who have sought deletion of the words ""Socialist"" and ""Secular"" from the Preamble of the Constitution. ""For the academic purpose, can a Preamble that has the date mentioned, be changed without altering the date of adoption. Otherwise, yes the Preamble can be amended. There is no problem with that,"" Justice Datta said.  Mr Swamy replied, ""That's precisely the question in the matter."" Justice Datta further said, ""this is perhaps the only Preamble I have seen which comes with a date. We give this Constitution to us on so and so date ... originally these two words (Socialist and Secular) were not there."" Mr Jain said that the Preamble of Constitution of India comes with a specific date, therefore it cannot be amended without discussion. Mr Swamy intervened and said that the 42nd Amendment Act was passed during the Emergency (1975-77). Justice Khanna, at the outset, told mr Swamy that the judges had received the case files early in the morning and due to the paucity in time, they had not gone through them.

After laying the foundation stone of a government school building in Mayur Vihar Phase III, Mr Kejriwal alleged that the BJP-led Centre has unleashed all its probe agencies against him as though he was the ""biggest terrorist"" of the country. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader has been asked to appear before a city court on February 17 in connection with a complaint case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him.  Mr Kejriwal has skipped five summonses issued against him by the federal agency for questioning in a money-laundering case linked to the alleged excise policy scam. The chief minister asserted that providing quality education to all children will eradicate poverty within a generation and said his government is opening schools after schools in Delhi to achieve that goal. The condition of the government schools in the national capital and education was hopeless earlier and the children of poor people had no future, he claimed. ""We have opened so many magnificent schools since the AAP government was formed in Delhi. Several new schools have been inaugurated recently, including in Burari, Rohini and Palam, in which 1.5 lakh children will get education,"" he said.

The new schools will have the best infrastructure, including laboratories, libraries, elevators and activity rooms, he said. ""We are fulfilling Dr (BR) Ambedkar's dream of providing education to all children,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

But we are going to do doorstep delivery of ration in Punjab from Saturday,"" the AAP leader said. Once the scheme is launched in Punjab, it could be done in Delhi also and the Centre will not be able to stop it, he added. The Centre has created many hurdles in the AAP government's work, saying Delhi is a half state, Mr Kejriwal alleged. ""I said let it be a full state. But, they do not do anything or let me do it,"" he said. Mr Kejriwal rued that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has labelled him as a ""thief"" even though he provided free electricity, healthcare and education to people in Delhi, while these facilities are expensive and of poor quality in the states ruled by the saffron party.

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/eye-on-lok-sabha-state-polls-bjp-meets-jagan-reddy-chandrababu-naidu-5024601,"Before Lok Sabha Polls, Jagan Reddy, Chandrababu Naidu In BJP Huddles","Ahead of a Lok Sabha election in a few weeks and a simultaneous state poll, it seems a swayamvar on in Delhi as the ruling BJP decides on a match from Andhra Pradesh. Less than 24 hours after Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu met Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP boss JP Nadda, Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy travelled to Delhi and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On the face of it, Mr Reddy is meeting the Prime Minister to discuss Special Category status for his state - a long-standing demand of his YSR Congress Party and the TDP - central funds and other issues. Analysts, however, say the meeting suggests the BJP is in its customary watch-and-wait mode, weighing its options before committing to either side (or remaining neutral) before the elections. Most likely, any understanding between the BJP and either the YSRCP or the TDP (which is allied, in the state, with actor Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena, a member of the BJP-led national alliance) will be informal, which the regional parties may prefer since a formal tie-up risks them losing minority votes.  That, interestingly, means neither Jagan Mohan Reddy nor Chandrababu Naidu wants the swayamvar to end with a public marriage; a private handshake might be the preferred outcome. That could be what the BJP wants too, despite Mr Modi's party not being a political force in the state; it was routed in the 2019 Assembly election, failing to win a single seat despite contesting all 173 in play. A formal alliance with either party might be seen as favourable but that comes with its own challenges, the biggest of which is seat-sharing. Neither the YSRCP nor the TDP will be very keen on surrendering seats to the saffron party, because it reduces their potential contested seats-to-win ratio. And the BJP, given its poor record from five years ago, and its big defeat in neighbouring Telangana in November last year, may not be in the strongest bargaining position. So while a backroom deal seems more likely, Chandrababu Naidu's chances of winning that support is seen as lesser than that of his state rival. The BJP, it seems, has been giving him the cold shoulder because of the way he walked out of the party-led National Democratic Alliance, twice. The last time was in 2018, when he was under pressure from Mr Reddy on the Special Category status issue. Back then the BJP had said the ""doors are closed forever (for the Andhra Pradesh party)"". Also, Mr Naidu has been on the backfoot with court cases filed against him and he will, therefore, prefer the party in power at the centre on his side. So he has been making overtures to the BJP. That might leave Mr Reddy in the lead, but he is likely to only want 'associate member' status. Mr Reddy, in fact, is very clear he wants only the best possible outcome for his state; he has said, as he did before the 2019 Lok Sabha poll too, he hopes no party gets a clear majority in the national election, so Andhra Pradesh has leeway to negotiate with whichever alliance forms the central government. Ultimately, it seems the BJP will win regardless of which way the Andhra Pradesh voters lean. Its strength in the state will come, as some analysts have remarked, from 'B' (for Chandrababu Naidu), 'J' (for Jagan Mohan Reddy), and 'P' for Pawan Kalyan, because all three are ready to back the BJP. Meanwhile, in the BJP camp opinion is divided on how the party should progress and if, in fact, there should be any alliance in Andhra Pradesh. One lobby, which including its state unit boss Daggubati Purandeswari, wants an alliance. Another feels going solo is a chance to establish itself in the state. That reasoning is based on the fact the Congress, which like the BJP has been nearly non-existent in the state since 2014, is trying to revive its fortunes, and is banking on Mr Reddy's sister, YS Sharmila.

The first 500,000 tons of capacity at the $1.2 billion facility in Mundra in Gujarat is set to start operations next month, according to Vinay Prakash, chief executive officer at Adani Natural Resources. This will be expanded to 1 million tons by March 2029 to cater for a forecast doubling of Indian copper demand by the end of the decade, he said in an interview. Adani Enterprises Ltd., the port-to-power conglomerate's flagship company, is seeking resource security in critical minerals and is resuming capital expenditure now that its shares have stabilized after a short-seller attack in January 2023. The smelter is starting up just as the global copper market experiences a collapse in the fees that processors charge miners because there's not enough ore to go around.  PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com A combination of high operating costs and the low fees means smelters and refiners globally may be forced to curtail production, Prakash said. ""Our plant will be a low-cost producer with higher metal recovery and this will help us to remain competitive in the market."" The concentrate deals are a mix of short- and long-term arrangements, Prakash said, without disclosing the suppliers. Concentrate supply is likely to increase in the medium- to long-term as more mining projects, including in Africa and Peru, come on stream, he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the award on X (formerly Twitter) hailing Mr Singh for his ""incomparable contributions"". ""He dedicated his life to the welfare of farmers... whether as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh or Home Minister of the country, and even as MLA, he always gave impetus to nation-building. He stood against the Emergency (and) his dedication to our farmer brothers and sisters is inspiring..."" Mr Modi said. The Bharat Ratna for Chaudhary Charan Singh comes amid reports of a seat-sharing deal between the BJP and the Rashtriya Lok Dal - founded by his son and now led by his grandson, Jayant Chaudhary.  And, minutes after Mr Modi's post, Mr Chaudhary tweeted: ""Dil jeet liya (Hearts have been won)."" दिल जीत लिया! #BharatRatnahttps://t.co/Ns0CraJ7yI Sources told NDTV the BJP will give the RLD - which has substantial support among Jats and farmers in western Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 MPs to Parliament's Lower House, the most of any state - two Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat in return for its support. NDTV was also told the RLD had made awarding a Bharat Ratna for Chaudhary Charan Singh a key condition for any agreement. Jayant Chaudhary's party is likely to get the Baghpat and Bijnor seats, and his wife may be made a Rajya Sabha candidate, sources have said. There was also talk of ministerial berths for the RLD. Sources said the BJP had offered two berths in UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's cabinet, but the RLD also wanted a seat in Prime Minister Modi's cabinet at the centre.

Faced with possibly losing the RLD's backing, Akhilesh Yadav yesterday told reporters Mr Chaudhary is a ""very well-educated person... (who) understands politics"". The former UP Chief Minister also said he hoped he would not weaken the struggle against the BJP ""for the welfare of farmers and prosperity of the state"". His party was more explicit; General Secretary Shivpal Yadav said ""Jayant will not go anywhere"", and accused the BJP of ""spreading confusion"". This morning too Akhilesh Yadav downplayed buzz of the RLD leaving, saying, ""There have been no talks. Whatever it is, (it) is being published in newspapers,..am getting information through you."" #WATCH | Lucknow: On speculations of Jayant Chaudhary-led RLD joining the BJP-led alliance in UP, Samajwadi Party Chief Akhilesh Yadav says, ""There have been no talks here.

Chaudhary Charan Singhji fought for farmers all his life... We are happy a farmer leader got Bharat Ratna,"" he said in the UP Assembly. The jab comes as the BJP faces yet another wave of protesting farmers; on Thursday farmers from UP's Noida and Greater Noida amassed on Delhi's border to agitate for better land prices. The sight of farmers penned behind police barricades, with riot control vehicles at the ready, were a replay of images from three years ago - when tens of thousands of farmers and their supporters marched on Delhi to protest the ""black farm laws"", triggering a massive image crisis for the BJP. Chaudhary Charan Singh's Bharat Ratna is the fifth announced this year; the government has also recognised Congress leader and former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur, and the BJP's LK Advani, as well as world-renowned agronomist MS Swaminathan. The awards come weeks before a general election and a number of Assembly polls, including one in Andhra Pradesh, which is Mr Rao's home state and one in which Mr Modi's BJP is scrambling for grip. Equally significant, Karpoori Thakur's award came shortly before Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar - his protege - executed (yet another) flip-flop, dumping the INDIA bloc and realigning with the BJP.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday lambasted the previous Congress-led UPA government for its mismanagement of the economy saying the party put ""family first"" and left the country in ""dire straits"" in 2014, but it is now lecturing the Modi government on handling the economy. Initiating the debate on the 'White Paper on Indian economy and its impact on the lives of people of India' in the Lok Sabha, Sitharaman said the Modi government put ""nation-first"", and took the economy from 'fragile five' to 'top five'. India is now on the way to become the third largest global economy, she said.  Amid constant bickering by the Congress members, Sitharaman said the White Paper is for record of posterity and the youth should know what efforts Prime Minister Narendra Modi has put in to restore India's past glory. ""Ten years of one government with some crisis and 10 years of a different government with a different crisis. The comparison shown in this 'White Paper' clearly says how if the government handles it with true sincerity, transparency and putting the nation first, the results are there for everybody to see,"" Sitharaman said. She also said, ""When you don't put the nation first, when you put your first family first, and when you have other consideration than transparency, the results are out there for you to see. So what happened after 2008 when there was a global financial crisis and what happened post-Covid shows clearly that if the intent of the government is sincere, results will be good."" The minister, in a spirited speech that was interrupted by the opposition members, said the Covid crisis was much ""deadlier"" than the global financial crisis of 2008, but the Modi government handled it with sincerity, transparency and dedication providing free vaccines to people. Further, the minister said UPA government in 2008 did not have a ""clean"" intention in dealing with the crisis. ""During the global financial crisis, Congress did nothing to protect the interest of nation and scandals after scandals continued to take place. They left the nation in dire straits in 2014. God knows what would have happened had they continued...They were unable to save the Indian economy. Those who could not handle the global financial crisis are now lecturing us how to deal with a crisis... ,"" she said. Referring to the coal scam during UPA, she cited the CAG report to say that it resulted in a huge loss of Rs 1.86 lakh crore to the country and the Supreme Court had to cancel licences of 214 coal blocks. The coal scam resulted in job losses, created coal shortage and power outages, she said, adding that investments too suffered. On the other hand, the Modi government conducted coal auctions in a transparent manner and now coal production has increased to 900 MT from 567MT in 2014. ""You turned coal into ashes, but the Modi government through its policies turned coal into diamonds,"" she said, adding that the Congress is now shredding ""crocodile tears"" even though coal bearing states had suffered revenue losses as a result of the scam during their time. Having given coal mines to the family members, friends and even a gutkha company, Sitharaman said ""they (Congress) are now giving us lecture on crony capitalism"". She also said that India witnessed the Commonwealth Games scam during UPA rule which brought ""bad name"" to the country, whereas G20 hosted by the Modi government was appreciated and lauded across the world. With respect to the banking sector, Sitharaman said the practice of phone banking during UPA time led to an increase in bad loans. The Modi government took a host of decisions and now the Non Performing Assets (NPAs) of public sector banks have declined to 3.2 per cent and their profitability has soared to Rs 1.08 lakh crore. Opposition members Saugata Roy (TMC) and N K Premchandran (RSP) objected to the discussion on the White Paper asserting that it was an attempt to defame the previous UPA government.

A pioneering treatment developed in India saved the life of a 64-year-old cancer patient. India's drug regulator, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), approved the commercial use of CAR-T cell therapy a few months ago and Dr (Col) VK Gupta became its first beneficiary, as per a report in the Indian Express. The Delhi-based gastroenterologist was declared ""free of cancer cells"", years after a failed bone marrow transplant. Here's everything you need to know about the therapy and its use. The Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell or CAR-T uses re-engineered cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors on their surface for cancer immunotherapy, according to a paper published by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). In simple language, the therapy includes genetically reprogramming a patient's immune system to fight cancer. It received CDSCO approval in October 2023. The therapy was incubated at Tata Memorial Centre and IIT Bombay laboratories, which helped Mr Gupta become disease free. For decades, oncologists have used chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to treat cancer patients. But this promising therapy modifies immune cells, specifically T-cells, by turning them into cancer fighters known as T-cells.  T-cells are special cells (white blood cells) that work towards maintaining the body's immunity and can kill other harmful cells. As part of the therapy, the T-cells are customised for each patient and then put back into the body where they go after cancer cells. The treatment is far less difficult for the patient compared to several sessions of chemotherapy. Laboratory tests and trials on animals showed that the homegrown CAR-T cell therapy has significantly fewer side effects compared to those developed in other countries. It also showed the ability to eradicate advanced leukemias and lymphomas. Existing methods of treatment may add a few months or years to a cancer patient's life, but therapies like CAR-T are designed to cure and provide life-long benefit. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com It makes treatment easier with a one-time therapy unlike several sessions of chemotherapy. The therapy also leads to significantly lower drug-related toxicities. On an average, cancer claim about eight lakh lives every year. So, treatment is expensive for a large section of the population. But according to Indian Express report, Mr Gupta paid Rs 42 lakh for the CAR-T therapy - a treatment that costs approximately Rs 3-4 crore abroad. He was given the drug NexCAR19, which is available in over 30 hospitals in more than 10 cities in India. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan made headlines this week for a jibe at Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar during the ongoing Budget Session of the Parliament. Apologising to all the members of the House during her farewell speech, Ms Bachchan said that she is short-tempered but did not mean to hurt anyone. ""People often ask me why I get angry. That's my nature, I can't change myself. If I don't like or agree with something, I lose my cool,"" Ms Bachchan said. ""If I behaved inappropriately with any of you, or got personal, I apologise,"" she added.  Fondly remembering the contribution of retiring members from the Rajya Sabha, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said the wisdom shared by them would be greatly missed and their departure would leave a void. ""The retirement of our esteemed colleagues will undoubtedly leave a void. It is often said that 'every beginning has an end and every end has a new beginning',"" he said. On Tuesday, Mr Dhankhar's remark on a Congress leader over the skipping of a question prompted a strong retort from Jaya Bachchan, who said that the members would have understood if the issue was explained to them and that they are ""not schoolchildren"". She also said that the MPs should be treated with respect.
